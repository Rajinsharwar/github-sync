<p>It&#8217;s an online course creator&#8217;s worst fear.</p>



<p>Spending countless nights working on the most valuable content possible, only to have no one sign up for your course.</p>



<p>Your potential students don&#8217;t receive the education they need to get to that next level, and you don&#8217;t get rewarded for all your hard work.</p>



<p>A lose-lose for everybody  .</p>



<p><strong>But don&#8217;t worry, it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way.</strong></p>



<p>Your course landing page is your opportunity to showcase the value of your course and convince potential students to take the next step and enroll.</p>



<p>If you can direct your audience to a course landing page that&#8217;s optimized for conversions, you&#8217;ll be seeing new signup notifications come in faster than you can swipe them away.</p>



<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll be sharing seven essential elements that every high-converting sales page should include.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-a-compelling-headline-that-communicates-the-benefits-of-your-course">1) A compelling headline that communicates the benefits of your course.</h2>



<p>The first thing your potential students will see is your headline, so it&#8217;s important to spend all the time you need to get this right.</p>



<p>The best course sales page headlines are specific, compelling, and action-oriented.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.handletteringforbeginners.com/better-lettering-course" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-headline-4-1024x627.jpg" alt="Example course headline" class="wp-image-3668"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://ofasignup.com/free-bonuses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-headline-2-1024x808.jpg" alt="Example course headline" class="wp-image-3599"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://learnfigmatowp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-headline-3-1024x505.jpg" alt="Example course headline" class="wp-image-3602"/></a></figure>



<p>It should grab the reader&#8217;s attention, clearly communicate the benefits of your course, and encourage the reader to take action.</p>



<p>What is the outcome you&#8217;re promising your students? And why should they learn this from you as opposed to anywhere else?</p>



<p>Here are some example frameworks you can use to craft your headlines:</p>



<ul>
<li>Discover how to [Achieve a Specific Goal], even if you&#8217;ve never [Common Obstacle] before</li>



<li>How to [Achieve a Specific Goal] in [Timeframe] or less</li>



<li>Master [Topic] in [Timeframe] with [Course Name]</li>



<li>Use the [Method] to Become an Expert [Skill]</li>



<li>Want to [Specific Outcome] but don&#8217;t know where to begin?</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: ask a friend in your target audience if your headline sounds appealing to them. Their answer might surprise you.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-a-comprehensive-description-of-the-course-content-structure">2) A comprehensive description of the course content &amp; structure.</h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got their attention, it&#8217;s time to expand on how you&#8217;ll deliver your promised outcome.</p>



<p>What are your students going to learn? What does the course structure look like? How is the information going to be presented?</p>



<p>This will give potential students a sense of the scope and depth of the course, and help them determine if it&#8217;s a good fit for their needs.</p>



<p>Just be careful to not give away too much of &#8216;the good stuff&#8217; here.</p>



<p>You want to continue focusing on why your content will help them achieve X, without going too deep into the details.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://thefutur.com/course/ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-description-1-1024x636.jpg" alt="Example course description" class="wp-image-3598"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.yourstoryschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-description-3-1024x451.jpg" alt="Example course description" class="wp-image-3606"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://liftoffcourse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-description-4-1024x906.jpg" alt="Example course description" class="wp-image-3609"/></a></figure>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: come up with a benefit for each module of your course, and use that as the outline for your course description.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-a-clean-and-professional-design">3) A clean and professional design.</h2>



<p>The design of your course landing page says a lot about how you present yourself.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s well-designed and professional, people will be more likely to trust you.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if it&#8217;s cluttered or looks like it was cobbled together in an hour, it might raise questions about the quality of your content.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to take into consideration the audience that you&#8217;re targeting when choosing an aesthetic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://studio.com/classes/david-blaine-card-magic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-design-1-1024x627.jpg" alt="Example of a nicely designed course landing page" class="wp-image-3671"/></a></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re selling a high-end course for business professionals, you&#8217;ll want your landing page to convey a sense of luxury.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re selling a course on gardening, you&#8217;ll want to keep the design light &amp; fun.</p>



<p>Again, if people have a positive experience with your course landing page, they&#8217;re going to see it as an extension of the rest of your course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.kadencewp.com/kadence-theme/starter-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-design-2-1024x627.jpg" alt="Example of a nicely designed course landing page" class="wp-image-3670"/></a></figure>



<p>Getting a nice design doesn&#8217;t need to be expensive either.</p>



<p>There are plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.learndash.com/build-your-course-website-in-record-time-with-kadence-starter-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful pre-built templates</a>&nbsp;available if you&#8217;re looking to get started quickly, or&nbsp;<a href="https://newpulselabs.com/best-figma-ui-kits-web-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-quality UI kits</a>&nbsp;if you want to design something more custom.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: when in doubt, it&#8217;s always better to keep your design simple.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-testimonials-from-happy-customers">4) Testimonials from happy customers.</h2>



<p>Potential students will look for proof that your course actually works, and there&#8217;s no better way to show them than through testimonials.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve had students go through your course before, reach out and ask them if they&#8217;d be willing to provide a short testimonial about their experience (<a href="https://newpulselabs.com/testimonial-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a great tool</a>&nbsp;that makes this entire process easy).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to get in the habit of writing these testimonials down or saving screenshots any time you see someone mention your course positively.</p>



<p>That way you&#8217;ll slowly build a repository of testimonials you can use throughout your ads, landing pages, checkout pages, email sequences etc.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thedesignership.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-testimonials-1-1024x504.jpg" alt="Example course testimonials" class="wp-image-3604"/></a></figure>



<p>If you don&#8217;t currently have any testimonials, don&#8217;t worry! You still have a couple options when first starting out.</p>



<p>A) You can offer course access for a hefty discount to anyone who is willing to provide a testimonial in return.</p>



<p>B) You can showcase testimonials of people you&#8217;ve worked with in the past. They only need to comment on your expertise in your niche, and not necessarily the contents of your course.</p>



<p>You can then sprinkle in more course-specific testimonials over time as more students are enrolled.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: you can never have too many testimonials on a page!</p>



<h2 id="h-5-a-clear-and-enticing-call-to-action-cta">5) A clear and enticing call-to-action (CTA).</h2>



<p>Now that your visitor understands how they&#8217;ll benefit from taking your course, it&#8217;s time to get them to take action.</p>



<p>This is generally via a button that takes the user to your course checkout page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-cta-3-1024x380.jpg" alt="Example course CTA" class="wp-image-3673"/></figure>



<p>While this sounds straightforward, there are a couple mistakes we see people make often.</p>



<p><strong>A) They don&#8217;t use enough CTAs.</strong></p>



<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure you present multiple opportunities throughout the page for your reader to take the next step.</p>



<p>Some people will be ready to sign up after reading your headline. Some will be ready after going through your course description. And others after they&#8217;ve gone through all testimonials.</p>



<p>Including multiple CTAs on your page makes it easier for them to take action the moment they&#8217;re ready.</p>



<p><strong>B) They use a generic call-to-action.</strong></p>



<p>You&#8217;ll often see a button with the text &#8220;Get Started&#8221; or &#8220;Sign Up&#8221;.</p>



<p>While this is still far better than nothing, it misses out on the opportunity to give your potential student that final push.</p>



<p>Try tying your selling proposition back into your CTAs.</p>



<p>You can do this through the button text itself, or by including a subheading right above your button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://liveoffyourpassion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-cta-1-1024x335.jpg" alt="Example course CTA" class="wp-image-3597"/></a></figure>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: you can use different CTAs throughout your page. Just make sure they all point to the same destination.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-a-money-back-guarantee-to-reduce-risk-for-your-student">6) A money-back guarantee to reduce risk for your student.</h2>



<p>If there&#8217;s anything stopping someone from purchasing your course, it&#8217;s the fear that they could potentially waste their time and money.</p>



<p>The more you can remove any risk from their purchase, the more likely they&#8217;ll be to sign up.</p>



<p>A common way course creators do this is through a money-back guarantee.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://habitsacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-guarantee-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Example course money-back guarantee" class="wp-image-3674"/></a></figure>



<p>Depending on what you&#8217;re teaching, there may be a couple different approaches you can use for a money-back guarantee.</p>



<p><strong>A) You can offer an *unconditional 14-day money-back guarantee.</strong></p>



<p>This option reduces risk for your student the most, as they&#8217;ll feel they have the freedom to change their mind after making the purchase.</p>



<p>The downside is that you may have students who take advantage of the guarantee &#8211; getting value from all the lessons, and then requesting a refund simply to get their money back.</p>



<p><strong>B) You can offer a *conditional 60-day money-back guarantee.</strong></p>



<p>This option often requires the student to show some kind of proof that the course didn&#8217;t work for them.</p>



<p>They tried the methods that you taught, but didn&#8217;t get the result you promised.</p>



<p>This will help prevent students from taking advantage of your money-back guarantee.</p>



<p>The downside is that since your student isn&#8217;t guaranteed a refund, this doesn&#8217;t reduce as much risk as option A.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip:&nbsp;</strong>don&#8217;t be afraid to experiment with different money-back guarantees to see how they impact your bottom line.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-a-personable-instructor-bio">7) A personable instructor bio.</h2>



<p>Courses are a highly personal experience.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just as important for your student to resonate with you as it is for them to resonate with your content.</p>



<p>By including a section about yourself (and any other instructors) on your landing page, you&#8217;re giving your potential student a chance to connect with you.</p>



<p>If you share the story of how you&#8217;ve come to be in the position you&#8217;re now in, they&#8217;re more likely to draw similarities to their own lives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://theartisandesigner.com/elevate-your-design-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-bio-1-1024x559.jpg" alt="Example course bio" class="wp-image-3611"/></a></figure>



<p>Done right, a good bio will go a long way in building trust and credibility for your potential student.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip:&nbsp;</strong>don&#8217;t be shy to inject your personality alongside your accomplishments. You don&#8217;t want to make it sound like a robot wrote your bio!</p>



<h2 id="h-wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>Now that you know the key components of a successful course landing page, it&#8217;s time to make magic happen!</p>



<p>Fine-tune your design &amp; copy so that you&#8217;re effectively communicating what life will look like for your student after they&#8217;ve finished your course.</p>



<p>And be sure to include multiple calls-to-action throughout your page so that they have plenty of opportunities to take the next step.</p>



<p>With these elements in place, you can be confident that your course content will reach the most number of students possible.</p>



<p><strong>A win-win for everyone</strong>&nbsp; .</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all for this one.</p>



<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Many training programs use online course platforms to deliver their content. It makes sense why: learners can study at their own pace, in their own time, and from anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>However, there&#8217;s an often overlooked (yet lucrative) sales opportunity when it comes to online training. Often, trainings can apply to a range of corporate clients. Therefore, your courses can be sold to other businesses.</p>



<p>Employers are often looking to invest in training programs that build new capabilities in their teams. They&#8217;re keen to add more value to their organization with online training opportunities.</p>



<p>Let’s explore more why it&#8217;s a good idea to sell your training courses and how to delight your corporate clients with a nuanced program.</p>



<h2 id="h-key-benefits-of-selling-trainings-to-other-organizations">Key benefits of selling trainings to other organizations</h2>



<h3 id="h-repeat-sales">Repeat sales</h3>



<p>Once you’ve established a strong relationship with key stakeholders, you’ll be seen as the go-to solution. For example, any new employees joining the business are likely to go through your training as part of their onboarding.</p>



<p>Repeat customers help reduce the need to continually market and recruit new students into your program. Why look elsewhere if you are providing an ongoing excellent product and service?</p>



<p>There’s often the opportunity to deliver a refresher training as well, as employers aim to keep skills fresh and relevant. As long as you continue to nurture the key relationships and deliver a high-quality program, expect to enjoy repeat sales.</p>



<h3 id="h-increased-revenue-opportunities">Increased revenue opportunities</h3>



<p>We’ve found that many B2B sales start with one specific request. For example, an HR team might require a specific solution to help them overcome an internal challenge.</p>



<p>After your online training has helped them overcome this problem, word will spread. Other managers may be interested in what else you can offer. Gaining trust within a company can increase your business and add a wide catalog of courses for you to offer.</p>



<h3 id="h-one-key-relationship-not-many">One key relationship, not many</h3>



<p>Your main contact within an organization could be with Human Resources, Learning and Development, or Procurement. Often, they will roll out the training and serve as the first point of contact for any issues a learner may be having.</p>



<p>Having one key contact within an organization helps funnel questions and avoids being overwhelmed by individual learner questions.</p>



<p>It’s critical to nurture the relationship with the key personnel in your client’s organization. They&#8217;ll be the person who keeps you informed on your training&#8217;s usefulness. A close relationship will</p>



<p>will also help foster new and repeat sales, as well as help you think of new course ideas, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-nuances-of-delivering-online-trainings-for-other-organizations">Nuances of delivering online trainings for other organizations</h2>



<p>Delivering your courses for clients isn&#8217;t always a smooth process. Corporate clients often come with their own processes and procedures. Here are a few nuances you should be willing and open to accommodate.</p>



<h3 id="h-reporting">Reporting</h3>



<p>Clients will want to understand how their team is progressing. This will ensure they are getting full value from their investment into your online training program.</p>



<p>If you don’t already include a knowledge check, add one to your course to measure the new capabilities their employees have developed. In addition, an analytics tool such as <a href="https://www.learndash.com/propanel-by-learndash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ProPanel</a> can provide key insights into how learners are progressing through the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, make sure your course outcomes are clearly listed and that the outcomes directly solve the client&#8217;s training needs. This will make it easier to measure how well your course delivers on the promise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Providing demonstrable results will help repeat business and give your key contact the data they need to prove why your solution works.</p>



<h3 id="h-tailoring-content">Tailoring content</h3>



<p>Your online course may be part of a wider company initiative. It’s likely that other company resources or programs may be used to&nbsp; support understanding. They may also wish to tailor some of the content so it is more industry or sector specific.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s wise to allow tailoring of your content so your client receives the most relevant training for them. This will help enhance the impact of your course and&nbsp; also deepen ties between you and your client.</p>



<p>However, consider the additional time and resources it’ll take to customize the content for the client and make that transparent.</p>



<h3 id="h-administration-and-enrollment">Administration and enrollment</h3>



<p>To keep your client happy, you’ll want to provide a hassle-free way to enroll learners that doesn’t put a major burden on you or the client.</p>



<p>LearnDash comes with many in-built features that help you deliver online training into other organizations. The <a href="https://www.learndash.com/whats-new-in-learndash-course-cloning-bulk-editing-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clone</a> feature is particularly powerful in saving time in spinning up customized courses for each client.</p>



<p>It’s also worth considering the<a href="https://www.training-spark.com/organization-toolkit-for-learndash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Organization Toolkit</a> by Training Spark. This has been specifically designed for delivering online training into other organizations. The Toolkit comes with useful tools like company shortcodes, reporting, and enrollment.</p>



<h2 id="h-create-successful-training-programs-with-learndash">Create Successful Training Programs with LearnDash</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s time to build out your course. You&#8217;ve purchased and installed LearnDash and have all your content, but there is a critical decision to make before getting started.</p>



<p>How should you structure your content to maximize learner engagement and course sales?&nbsp;</p>



<p>LearnDash, like all top Learning Management Systems, has a content hierarchy. So rather than having a flat learning experience where you move from one lesson to another, you can group content into sections, lessons, and lesson topics.</p>



<p>The structure of your content plays a significant role in the experience and marketability of your courses&#8211; it&#8217;s worth doing right.</p>



<p>This article will cover the LearnDash content hierarchy, the psychological principles influencing learner engagement and sales, and how to identify the right structure for your course content.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start by discussing the LearnDash content hierarchy.</p>



<h2 id="h-learndash-content-hierarchy">LearnDash Content Hierarchy</h2>



<p>As previously discussed, LearnDash segments content into sections, lessons, topics, and quizzes. This segmentation allows you to group your content into themes and smaller, more manageable bites. Below you&#8217;ll see a screenshot representing each segment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Q99p38XV39ONCR04zwjcQ_G7EYCuOyBpaC31TQHkvi6V7WmkUlU3yLXVoHXBj-50a-ZpDY-exKgf3Ogp83rQGTTfC01NFgnsAXxowZAum9G3b3QxeUnaP-UGSJ4x1yb8mOzpQ6_kIVwqxjdLvOd8a8Ot0T5txTVRfM2HOWJS3IsVqz4dXWpXPrW_pFNptA.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Let&#8217;s cover each segment in more detail.</p>



<h3 id="h-lessons">Lessons</h3>



<p>Lessons are the highest content in the LearnDash hierarchy. When learners start a course, their first action is moving into the first lesson. They then work through each subsequent lesson until the course is complete.</p>



<p>If you have a simple course, you might only have lessons.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-sections">Sections</h3>



<p>Sections are simply groups of lessons. In short, adding a section allows you to split lessons visually with a heading in-between. There are advantages to this which influence both sales and engagement, which we&#8217;ll discuss below.</p>



<h3 id="h-topics">Topics</h3>



<p>Topics are children of lessons. They behave much like lessons in terms of capability but are only accessible by first navigating into the parent lesson. Topics allow you to split longer lessons into more manageable, multi-step bites, which can increase engagement.</p>



<h3 id="h-quizzes">Quizzes</h3>



<p>Quizzes can appear in several places within the LearnDash content hierarchy. For example, they can be at the top level alongside lessons, be a child of a lesson (similar to topics,) or be a child of a topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only factor to note is quizzes at the lesson level can only occur at the end of a course. Therefore, if you want a quiz to occur before or after a lesson, it must be a child quiz.</p>



<h3 id="h-assignments">Assignments</h3>



<p>Assignments are instances where users must submit a file or answer an open-ended question to proceed. That file can be auto-approved or manually approved. Lessons and topics can have assignments. Segments cannot, however, because they don&#8217;t have a dedicated page. Instead, they&#8217;re just a visual break between lessons.</p>



<p>Now that you understand the LearnDash content structure let&#8217;s talk about the psychological factors influencing how best to map your content into this hierarchy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-design-psychology">Design Psychology</h2>



<p>The ideal course content hierarchy is influenced by psychology. Upon seeing your course outline, learners and prospects will make assumptions and judgments about the value and complexity of your course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re less likely to buy if the course structure doesn&#8217;t facilitate a straightforward assessment of course value. Similarly, they&#8217;re unlikely to buy if the format makes the course feel overwhelming or complex.</p>



<p>From an existing learner&#8217;s standpoint, the course structure directly impacts how engaging the course is and can be the difference between a course completion or abandonment.</p>



<p>There are three primary psychological principles at play:</p>



<ul><li>Chunking</li><li>Progressive Disclosure</li><li>Gamification</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-chunking">Chunking</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s easier to process and consume large amounts of information when grouped into common themes. For example, if I asked you to remember the following list, you would likely struggle:</p>



<ol><li>Carrots</li><li>Hamburger</li><li>Oranges</li><li>Brocolli</li><li>Watermelon</li><li>Celery</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Pork chops</li><li>Bacon</li></ol>



<p>However, if I break it into groups, it&#8217;s much more manageable.</p>



<p><strong>Vegetables</strong></p>



<ol><li>Carrots</li><li>Brocolli</li><li>Celery</li></ol>



<p><strong>Proteins</strong></p>



<ol><li>Hamburger</li><li>Pork chops</li><li>Bacon</li></ol>



<p><strong>Fruits</strong></p>



<ol><li>Oranges</li><li>Watermelon</li><li>Strawberries</li></ol>



<p>Sections and topics allow you to group content into themes. Like the grouping above, this reduces the cognitive load to process the themes and concepts taught in the course. In turn, the course is more manageable for existing learners, and potential buyers better understand the course value.</p>



<p>Consider these two examples, lesson with and without the segments:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/wEA0nWfCWG6T8oOfVqW2DOjze8Jcnzi3-6-UMs8DRPuF54p29RV3a50gBgvxFoE-BNZ1mWk71D-Lhcw91kOF7Z-LDK37NuYyKu1h6vPDiXbtonY0Sz65laevWXEmAxwsr-GRvefCE-JK21a4i3kORTblvAj66c4zsSTA6OPEqMqWaU3HIaGm652ICrJidw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>and&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/NmpCVl2U6l81-DvRZ3mnYSE-6BWWR8cy_icHBCyyX7CnO2_k1_zmWkaaSmntpApyyRZhfkfKALfdUkSzeMOOlsC1xdy5Po-RfEC4rJ0VpBKoeA9BIEU_pE6_N_-Ln0vvbTWUg3d7XkGTQkHv8IswRJ4jydN1SvCanQUN3yzoEdmKETjBIM5IPyuty6COiw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Which is easier to process and understand? The second example.</p>



<p>A related and equally important psychological principle is &#8220;Progressive Disclosure,&#8221; let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h3 id="h-progressive-disclosure">Progressive Disclosure</h3>



<p>Progressive disclosure is a concept where it&#8217;s easier to process information when you are exposed to high-level information initially and can opt to see more detail when desired.</p>



<p>An example would be an archive of blog posts on your website. You typically wouldn&#8217;t display each entire post on a single page. Instead, you have the most pertinent information, like the title and short description, with a link to show the full post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using summaries instead of the entire post makes it easier to identify all the topics discussed on the blog, and decide which to interact with and see more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/pHrqmiKyBnlF9xKDKVYorSt2b622rXUuV1abvMdzL6WWtFuXy3mtZmZCSq7RpqL6_s7pSgMJRVjyCQ6x0qRUfQ2d7aAu-82wabFfehwr4ftWIZO75Ou7QwpQPyuuffu_SSffg_ZOjo3rLMYe-STl4V85MV_1jQf8QO-PW_iJPrj0IaS7d8m2xGTytTh_qA.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>You can use progressive disclosure in your course through topics and child quizzes. Your lessons become the highest-level concepts, and learners can expand the lesson to see more detailed concepts.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s expand on our previous example above:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/8prLREcjtv1hTS5YwLNmX6-ttYSf6nZovfia0l02zjMbvFt0Q1G6TdNAkgOrY3APlk9av8taobvRvqggyKekBDUwHl_l-_dYuILVLL3DKvWscoo6eMdeK0GnbLc1blgKS4xJtNK-G-dg6s0-mnrid1vlTKUL57V3Wj5-EzOALqSS-7fGJy5I8EfJaCAPw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Like chunking, it&#8217;s easier for prospects to comprehend the core concepts taught in your course, increasing the likelihood of buying. In addition, for existing learners, the course feels less overwhelming as there are fewer steps to focus on at a given time.</p>



<h3 id="h-gamification">Gamification</h3>



<p>You can use two gamification principles to shape your course structure, &#8220;Investment Loops&#8221; and &#8220;Appropriate Achievements.&#8221;</p>



<p>Making progress within a course (like completing a section, lesson, topic, or quiz) activates our reward centers. We&#8217;re making progress toward a goal, and it feels good. The more you can trigger this positive feeling, the more motivated learners will be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Triggering our reward center is a balance. For example, the Appropriate Achievements principle states that to trigger reward feelings, the next step must be difficult enough to feel challenging but not so difficult it feels unobtainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In execution, each step of your course should be just long and complex enough to challenge the learner but short enough to feel immediately achievable. So rather than an extended lesson that covers 3 &#8211; 5 complex concepts, you have a single lesson with 3 &#8211; 5 topics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now you have a handful of steps that will take 3 &#8211; 5 minutes instead of one that will take 15 &#8211; 20. As a result, learners can tackle one or two quickly, which feels rewarding, vs. needing more time or energy to complete one more significant step.</p>



<p>This approach also triggers an &#8220;Investment Loop,&#8221; where you feel fulfilled for completing a step but still want more. As a result, learners are more likely to complete three 5min steps than one 15min one.</p>



<p>Pro tip! Visually indicating how long a step will take is a great way to increase learner engagement. <a href="https://snaporbital.com/learndash-visual-customizer/">Visual Customizer for LearnDash</a> allows you to do so in minutes!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/sRgQKj4jTwJXs-_Omayl8dXV-V5U09LHO3F3zOrnEZZ2HCpKqsRdt0UKdUL2Wq_u46Wv0Bf_65BIC47E7sKYBDwxKrO4q416yoWEgnId0TGmeVaTFSLMhsbDZfM0DdR_1_9LMKgA0Mrc1DWrzE6uC1mP4JndmoVUyc2-3L8_ftAMIE3JLYgFJeseyaU2pA.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Now that you understand the psychology behind segmenting your content into sections, lessons, topics, and quizzes, let&#8217;s cover how to identify the optimal course content structure.</p>



<h2 id="h-creating-your-content-outline">Creating Your Content Outline</h2>



<p>Before you populate any content in LearnDash, I recommend creating a &#8220;content outline,&#8221; a collection of bulleted lists that identify the sections, lessons, topics, and quizzes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-broad-themes">Broad Themes</h3>



<p>First, start by creating a list of the major themes or concepts the course will teach learners. If you end up with more than 10, I&#8217;d recommend seeing if you could combine them into a more generalized theme.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/V7HcCgMl-oKtAGb1IMl4B_5u-_K09duOtlLpRmNSwLLp80AHJULqNzRRPhi35XoXLI_qQmwWkUvXjghjLjHEvWB4iaHHhwMFQj8iGwKeNzQ6BSGgV-PhCBYwyfGriQTeTnvfCn5oEoGhFd800gLrjfSNyGsjDU3RwKDKgIB3ZqSn3SEZxQQsKWSdYtOREQ.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 id="h-primary-and-sub-concepts">Primary and Sub Concepts</h3>



<p>Then, within each of the 3 &#8211; 7 broad themes, create a nested list of the 3 &#8211; 7 concepts within those themes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/4HlU_lKhbHk7x8uAShLZpKlAq9qcKHGopeAHV-nZx6Gul_BxfbahVbLbV3cT1jCXfDH95ZoZ4nvouLeL1Tnnc3I-ad0SwQNYwuHZc1qPbyq0z3fY9D8K4by15Z7WPlpb0aNT-y7kFvJHNuCg37aBh10xXYcpGBL2HatQ_iUxRTJnnrm0LK3aQFPgym1eew.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Now evaluate each idea and assess how long it would take to fully explain the concept to someone who knew nothing about it. If the answer is more than 5 &#8211; 7 minutes, then you need another layer of hierarchy. Split your 3 &#8211; 7 sub-concepts into another 3 &#8211; 7 sub-sections.</p>



<p>If you need more than seven sub-sub sections or find it would still take longer than 5minutes to explain, consider splitting this one course into several focused courses.</p>



<h3 id="h-sections-or-topics">Sections or Topics</h3>



<p>Now you have between two and three layers in your content hierarchy. You&#8217;ll use sections, lessons, and topics if you have three layers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/8WCQ-bAjaXL3b0L7N-pWnVMG_snRr7fC71IqaZfU9pJkwUMs_AA9tVk1Fn_7_3-5uOOTgxIEjw8B8OIyrsckuLmGAv7C-iGshv2KBNflOwfR2ZlF1INf_Wz2IrT0wRr0xQoq9wEe5WPY_c6HqOAKWPhq4_mag-GUCGvl28aLyYFSDDc6MWODIIWHT7xaA.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>You must choose topics or sections for your hierarchy if you only have two.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d look at it like this: your lessons are like your book table of contents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The table of contents is a significant factor in the decision to purchase a book. Similarly, users will scan your list of lessons to decide if they want to buy. So there is some advantage to having more lessons provided you can keep it from overwhelming. For example, 15 lessons split into three sections will better &#8220;sell&#8221; your course than three lessons with five topics each (because more information is hidden.)</p>

<p>Everyone with an email inbox knows that major businesses use Black Friday to bring in new customers, sell products, and connect with an existing customer base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, just because you’re a small online business owner doesn’t mean you can’t get a piece of the Black Friday pie, too.</p>



<p>Here are five ways to take advantage of Black Friday and Cyber Monday for your online course business.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-create-an-irresistible-offer">Create an irresistible offer</h2>



<p>When most people first think of creating an irresistible offer, they automatically think about drastically discounting the price of their product or service. In reality, an irresistible offer is simply a strategic structuring of your products and/or services where the value exceeds the costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some ways to create an actionable offer:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bundling. </strong>Think of packaging valuable courses together at an attractive price for customers that still means high sales for you.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Value adds.</strong> You could add in personal one-on-one coaching, a free session, office hours, or early access to make a high-value offer that’s more than a discount.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Risk Reversal.</strong> This means that your course will provide the results promised without risk to the customer. This is mostly seen as a “money back guarantee” policy or the first lesson free. This can reduce hesitation at purchase.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Segmentation.</strong> Create different offers based on purchase history. For example, existing customers don’t need a great deal on your intro courses, but may be more interested in continuing education opportunities you provide.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Time limit. </strong>A timer on an offer compels people to act fast. Make your coupon window narrow with “early bird” and “last chance” incentives to create a sense of urgency.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-start-building-excitement-now">Start building excitement now</h2>



<p>In the days leading up to your Black Friday sale, your messages should get your audience excited and looking forward to your special offer. You want them clearly aware that you&#8217;re coming out with a Black Friday promotion.</p>



<p>A great way to build buzz is with a “Pre Launch” page. This can start as a “Coming Soon” page that will be changed to a “Special Offer” page as soon as your promotion officially goes live.</p>



<p>When thinking of what to add to a prelaunch/landing page, consider the following:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>A catchy headline and clear copy:</strong> Make sure you are clearly describing your course and stating your value proposition. Be urgent and catchy, but also direct and clear, to compel sign-ups.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Visual elements:</strong> add pictures, a sneak peek of your content, and if you have it, a video.</li>



<li><strong>Clear call to action: </strong>a CTA (call to action) refers to the link button where visitors can purchase your deals. It is important that all your CTAs are clearly visible and accessible anywhere on your landing page to make it easy for your potential customers.</li>



<li><strong>Social proof elements:</strong> if you have collected reviews from your past students, add them to your landing page to reinforce the value of your offer.</li>



<li><strong>A place to collect email addresses</strong>: if your deal is not live yet, add a place for potential customers to add their emails and get notified about your Black Friday offer. After Black Friday, the form could be a newsletter sign-up.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Refund Policy</strong>: Sentences like &#8220;Money Back Guaranteed&#8221; or &#8220;Risk-Free&#8221; will inform your customers about the refund policy and reassure even the most cautious buyers.</li>



<li><strong>Contact Information: </strong>Provide a way for potential learners to reach out to you so you can offer them a feeling of security and improve your image as the course creator.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-create-an-email-sales-series">Create an Email Sales Series</h2>



<p>You can’t just send one email for Black Friday and one email for Cyber Monday anymore. Driving the most sales from your emails requires a well-thought-out strategy and plan. You need to build excitement through pre-Black Friday and Cyber Monday emails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are the five emails we think you should send for Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Email 1 </strong>(2 weeks before Black Friday): Announce that something big is coming</li>



<li><strong>Email 2 </strong>(a few days later): Reveal the upcoming offer</li>



<li><strong>Email 3 </strong>(a week before Black Friday): Launch the offer with a clear, clickable coupon code</li>



<li><strong>Email 4</strong> (on Black Friday): Offer reminder</li>



<li><strong>Email 5 </strong>(A few days after): Offer ending – last chance</li>
</ul>



<p>Make your emails short and to the point with easily visible CTAs. Consider adding a countdown to your emails as well.&nbsp; Make your email stand out with value-driven subject lines, rather than “Black Friday Sale” or “Our Biggest Sale.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-set-up-abandoned-cart-recovery">Set Up Abandoned Cart Recovery</h2>



<p>Cart abandonment is when shoppers add items to their cart but don’t complete the purchase. Following up on abandoned carts allows you to recover lost profit by sending reminder emails or follow-up messages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visitors abandon their carts for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Additional fees not shown on your course landing page</li>



<li>Complicated checkout process with too many steps</li>



<li>Security concerns (is this website safe?)</li>



<li>Unclear fulfillment instructions (How soon can purchasers access the course?)</li>



<li>Technical issues or website glitches</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re using the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/woocommerce/">WooCommerce shopping cart integration with LearnDash, </a>then you can set up an abandoned cart strategy in minutes. You can use a plugin or email service as well to set up a trigger for abandoned cart emails.</p>



<p>Or, you can try to avoid cart abandonment altogether: think of auto-applying coupons, adding live chat to your website, and offering different payment options. If you create these trust elements at checkout, users will convert more often.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-extend-your-offer-to-giving-tuesday">Extend Your Offer to Giving Tuesday</h2>



<p>Giving Tuesday is a global movement encouraging people to spread generosity through philanthropy. Giving Tuesday takes place every year on the Tuesday following Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. You can incorporate Giving Tuesday into your Black Friday / Cyber Monday strategy by extending your original offer through end-of-day Tuesday, with a portion of your Tueaday profits going towards charity.</p>



<p>Craft a custom email that will go out on Giving Tuesday. This email should highlight a few things: A brief explanation of Giving Tuesday, your fundraising goal, the organization you plan to donate to, and how much of your sales will be going toward donations. Make sure to share additional ways your subscribers can support the cause even if they don’t make a purchase on your site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Send a special thank you email to anyone who buys your course this day. You can even include a small gift to really show your appreciation.</p>



<h2 id="h-build-a-black-friday-sale-with-learndash">Build a Black Friday Sale with LearnDash&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Coupons are a tried-and-true way to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-coupon-marketing-strategies-to-close-course-sales/">increase sales</a>. A coupon can be super effective <em>if</em> implemented at the right times. However, rely on a coupon too much, and customers will always come to expect one. They’ll begin to wait or delay a purchase hoping a coupon or sale pops up soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how you can best implement coupons to increase&nbsp; sales of your online courses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-to-use-coupons">When to use coupons</h2>



<p><strong>As a prelaunch strategy</strong>. Increase the earning potential for your new course by <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-create-a-pre-launch-marketing-strategy/">building interest before it launches</a>. A coupon is great to pair with a gated course, as it’s hard for customers to know what they’re getting before they buy. A coupon will incentivize hesitant folks to make the financial investment in your course and will help boost those initial sales. Keep in mind that your “early bird” sale should be your best offer. Those who bought in early may feel cheated by a better option later. Moreover, they’ll see a better offer as a sign that the course didn’t sell well and that they overpaid.</p>



<p><strong>To gain repeat customers</strong>. Loyalty goes a long way to increase sales, and coupons can help cultivate loyalty among your customer base. For instance, you can offer existing customers early access and a discount to new courses to retain their business. You can also create a loyalty system where customers unlock codes once they’ve taken a certain amount of courses.  One effective strategy is to invite your learners to share a special code with friends and coworkers who might be interested in taking the course with them. For any referral that signs on, your learner gets their own discount. It’s a great way to encourage word of mouth sharing and to passively increase sales among your target audience.</p>



<p><strong>To create a sense of urgency</strong>. If given the option to pay less, most folks will jump on an opportunity when they see it. Sales and limited discounts create a sense of scarcity. Folks will find a timer on a coupon as a reason to purchase now, giving you a quick boost in sales.  Keep in mind that the timing should be well-reasoned. Use special occasions, sales weekends and holidays, or historic slow weeks for your business to implement a timed coupon.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-practices-when-creating-coupons">Best Practices when Creating Coupons</h2>



<p>Setting up a coupon is super simple. Navigate to LEARNDASH LMS > Coupon and click on “Add New.” From there, you can customize to your liking. As you personalize, keep the following in mind:</p>



<p><strong>Give it a good name</strong>. Use a coupon name that relates to the purpose, such as “back to school sale.” A coupon should have a smart but short name to catch a potential customer’s eye. In your LearnDash settings, you can name your unique coupon in the “coupon code” field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/MEW-26nZaJkJZeVGlRWzD25FndU3Ige9L2mzN05oCdSgBL6sN4Proj83KbcgsP6VxSWH9hGuy9sMr14MadnRV1J_gJ4tLZco5V7Hht-rwdofM34c_rUETvA12eIrpCpCMcnw3dRc1IbaQEjuqXfytlFNIWuI2YKB6pEfNhHJTPElSDoY7Z9taYaMIw" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>Choose the right discount</strong>. How much to discount an online course might seem like a difficult question, but it’s easier than it seems. Try the<a href="https://www.business2community.com/strategy/works-best-percentage-deal-money-offer-01091418#5wdKS8MwD1IwQEwc.97"> rule of 100</a>: everything below $100 should be a percentage deal, while everything above should be a money-off deal. In your LearnDash settings, you’ll chose “Flat Rate” or “Percentage,” and customize from there.</p>



<p><strong>Set an expiration date</strong>. Expiration dates offer a sense of urgency and pressure to act, as well as speed up the purchasing behaviour. Always add a time limit and make that visible during your campaign. In your LearnDash settings, this is as simple as marking your Start and End date. </p>



<p><strong>Limit usage</strong>. Create a limited number of coupons to create urgency and scarcity. Creating a variety of types gives you more control over distribution (such as different customer segments, channels, or seasonal promotions). It can also help you better monitor the effectiveness of each coupon. In your LearnDash settings, you can limit the number or redemptions, courses, or groups that a coupon can apply to. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/y4j5WHYJs7XeZfDCDsQQIiNzbqv3kP25kDp3wYQdEHI5eJyhzCx6_DZFwg0ZLlRw2PHZ4uWEsZsDtQFUD2TDr6MWKdZZSVFDGj07NFnAJ-c4GL8Qr9yEP83zPPfo_H3KJf8mi5r5vkbdGfEqRpRlilV24Y6O2LzLhCWaaXmSdAfrezxbQD25wncPeA.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-create-custom-coupons-with-learndash">Create Custom Coupons with LearnDash</h2>



<p>The best part is that with LearnDash, deciding when to offer a coupon is your decision. Online course marketplaces like<a href="https://www.learndash.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-udemy/"> Udemy</a> force course creators to have perma-sales, which limit their profits. If you use your own course site, such as one built on <a href="https://www.learndash.com/pricing-and-purchase/?gclid=CjwKCAjwp9qZBhBkEiwAsYFsb13wFZ2s67QcjRSt3XjmRosnJV63HTjpXwvkcNDIXO1BRT2jFU4HiBoCsT4QAvD_BwE">LearnDash Cloud</a>, you can turn a sale off or on and limit coupons to those who would be most incentivized to use one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you’re able to control coupons, you can use them to your advantage for quick sales boosts. Plus, you&#8217;re building your <em>own</em> brand (not Udemy’s), and you don’t need to split revenue. You own all the student data, which can be leveraged for better marketing. In other words: you are in control.</p>

<p>Prepare yourself. You are about to learn about why course-based websites may be required to have Privacy Policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alright, so maybe not the most exciting topic, but it’s an important one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Privacy is becoming a bigger and bigger deal. Consumers are expecting website owners to respect their privacy, and non-compliance fines can be quite expensive simply for failing to disclose your own privacy practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>If your course website is collecting regulated data, you have an obligation to provide specific details so your visitors understand what you’re doing with their data.</strong></p>



<p>This article (and webinar!) is intended to provide course creators with the basics for what website policies are, when they are required for certain course-creator websites, and what you can do to get proper policies in place (and keep them up to date over time).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we move any further, it’s important for us to note that this article and webinar is not legal advice and is for informational purposes only. You should speak to an attorney in your area for assistance with your compliance needs.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 id="h-what-is-regulated-data">What is regulated data?</h1>



<p>Things like names, email addresses, and IP addresses are being regulated under a multitude of <a href="https://termageddon.com/laws-require-privacy-policy/">privacy laws throughout the world</a>.&nbsp; If you are collecting this regulated data, you may be required to have a Privacy Policy, regardless of where you are located.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is already a huge takeaway: governments that create privacy laws don’t care about where your business is located. They care about protecting their people’s data. If people from anywhere can submit their names and emails to your website or sign up for your course, you may be required to comply with multiple privacy laws and your Privacy Policy must make the disclosures required under each one (yes, each privacy law is different).</p>



<h1 id="h-is-collecting-regulated-data-bad">Is collecting regulated data bad?</h1>



<p>Not at all! You just have to make some disclosures about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collecting data like names, emails, and IP addresses helps you gather leads from your website and grow your course. It also helps you make improvements to your website over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only thing that has really changed is that you need to be conscious of your privacy practices and ensure you have the respective policies on your website that contain the proper disclosures you specifically are required to make under the law(s) that apply to you.</p>



<h1 id="h-does-your-website-course-collect-regulated-data">Does your website course collect regulated data?</h1>



<p>Virtually all modern websites collect regulated data. It’s darn near a requirement to ensure spammers aren’t trying to attack your contact forms and it would be impossible to take payments otherwise.&nbsp; So collecting data is normal for websites, and it may be a lot more common than you think.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Common features for course platforms that collect regulated data:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Course and membership registrations;</li>



<li>Accepting payments;</li>



<li>Embedded 3rd party videos;</li>



<li>Engagement triggers;</li>



<li>Rewarding your Learners;</li>



<li>Email drips;</li>



<li>Discussion forums;</li>



<li>LearnDash Integrity; and</li>



<li>Quizzes.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Common integrations where course creators are sharing data with third parties:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Embedding 3rd party videos for courses (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.);</li>

<p>As you can see, collecting and even sharing data is quite common when operating a modern day website.&nbsp; It’s just important to understand the importance of having a properly compliant Privacy Policy in place, providing the disclosures you specifically are required to make.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 id="h-when-do-privacy-laws-start-applying-to-businesses">When do privacy laws start applying to businesses?</h1>



<p>Privacy laws start applying to a website owner the moment they <strong>collect</strong> regulated data, not when they share that data or sell it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h1 id="h-why-should-i-care">Why should I care?</h1>



<p>You should have website policies to make more sales and avoid non-compliance <a href="https://termageddon.com/laws-require-privacy-policy/">fines or lawsuits</a>. In other words, by using website policies, you build trust and help comply with laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Privacy isn’t going anywhere (for example, there are six new privacy laws going into effect next year affecting websites) and failure to provide a fully compliant Privacy Policy is what gets website owners into trouble when it comes to privacy laws (where fines start at $2,500 per website visitor whose rights you’ve infringed upon).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should consider joining our webinar where we’ll discuss the basics of website policies, how to obtain proper ones, and how to easily keep them up to date over time!</p>



<h1 id="h-how-often-do-you-need-to-update-your-privacy-policy">How often do you need to update your Privacy Policy?&nbsp;</h1>



<p>At the time of writing this article, we have 6 new privacy laws going into effect next year, each requiring new disclosures if applicable to your business. On top of that, there are dozens of privacy bills proposed in the United States alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>As privacy becomes a bigger and bigger deal, it is important you have a strategy in place to keep your policies up to date with new disclosures.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 id="h-so-how-do-you-get-a-privacy-policy">So how do you get a Privacy Policy?</h1>



<p>A Privacy Policy helps explain to your website visitors the information you collect, what you do with that information, who you share it with, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will first&nbsp; have to identify the privacy laws that apply to you (as a reminder, privacy laws outside of where you are located can apply to you, as privacy laws protect people, not businesses).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only after you identify the laws that apply to you, can you figure out what specific disclosures you need to make.&nbsp; Below we outline two options of getting a proper Privacy Policy in place. But first, let’s discuss a common mistake.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-high-risk-option-privacy-policy-templates">High risk option: Privacy Policy templates</h2>



<p>A lot of people try to find cheap and/or free templates for their Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this is one of those ‘too good to be true’ kind of scenarios.&nbsp; Templates do not help you figure out what disclosures your Privacy Policy needs to make based on the privacy laws that apply to you.&nbsp; If you don’t know the laws apply to you, then there is no way for you to know what disclosures you’re specifically required to make. And because privacy laws require different disclosures for different business and privacy practices, that means that templates cannot be truly compliant for all business types.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, templates do not update your Privacy Policy over time with new disclosure requirements, whether it be from new or amended privacy laws.&nbsp; Having no strategy to keep your Privacy Policy up to date over time puts you at risk of missing the disclosure that you were required to make, which can result in noncompliance related fines and lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-privacy-attorneys-vs-privacy-policy-generators">Privacy Attorneys vs Privacy Policy Generators</h2>



<p><strong>Best, but expensive option: </strong>Nothing beats hiring a privacy attorney to help you draft and update your Privacy Policy, because privacy attorneys will provide you with legal advice. When selecting a privacy attorney (check out <a href="https://iapp.org/">iapp.org</a> for a list), you will want to ensure they understand who you&#8217;re collecting data from, your business practices, and more.&nbsp; Be sure to ask them upfront what their pricing is and their process for drafting your Privacy Policy. You’ll want to make sure they take all privacy laws into account that could apply to you, not just the ones within your jurisdiction.&nbsp; Also, be sure to ask them what their fees are with regard to monitoring privacy laws and keeping your Privacy Policy up to date with new disclosures. If the attorney is not monitoring changes in privacy laws, it may be best to consider contacting another attorney.</p>



<p><strong>Second best, but affordable option:</strong> You can use a <a href="https://termageddon.com/policies/privacy-policy-generator/">Privacy Policy generator</a> to quickly generate comprehensive policies for your website.&nbsp; Generators typically charge between $100-$200/year and offer a variety of additional policies, making it significantly more affordable when compared to hiring an attorney ongoing for your policies. The downside to using a generator is that they are a tech company and thus do not provide legal advice.&nbsp; When selecting a Privacy Policy generator, you may want to verify that the company has (or is founded by) privacy attorneys actively working at the company. You’ll also want to ensure the tool helps you identify the laws you need to make disclosures for, as well as having the ability to push updates automatically to your policy pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’ve created a course, or <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-reasons-to-create-your-first-online-course/">dreamed of launching your own course series</a>, you’ve probably thought about your launch strategy. Do you imagine a huge event and a limited release? Or, are you considering an evergreen course that will always be available?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which to use? Which is best?</p>



<p>There’s a lot to consider when deciding to go evergreen or open/close on your launch strategy. We’ll break down what you need to consider for each strategy based on three factors: the marketing effort, the income potential, and the learner experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marketing-effort">Marketing Effort</h2>



<p>The marketing strategy for an open/close launch requires <strong>urgency and scarcity</strong>. Scarcity can happen naturally: say there are 100 open seats in your course. This automatically creates a sense of urgency. Your marketing material can focus on acting fast or early bird deals. Keep in mind most people buy either on the first or the last day, so plan big for those two days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The launch-style approach is a good fit for folks who are comfortable with short release windows and doing a decent amount of work upfront to prepare. Also, if marketing is not your strong suit, a launch model is quick and short. Most of your effort will rely on awareness of deadline and urgency to register.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, an evergreen approach requires <strong>ongoing promotion</strong>. There’s no big pressure at any given time to drive sales and make your course feel scarce. In fact, you could step away for a few days and not fear that your entire business would fall apart. However, you’ll always be thinking of ways to make sure your course is getting in front of your audience. This may require more strategy and tactical marketing campaigns with ongoing initiatives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-potential-income">Potential Income&nbsp;</h2>



<p>An open/close launch strategy wil provide an <strong>initial surge of money </strong>right around launch. A rush of registrations in a two week period may provide all the funding you’ll need for months. However, this requires a close eye on budgets and predictive models to ensure you’re making back what you’ve spent on the planning, execution, and marketing of the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This launch style is can often be inconsistent or unpredictable. If you hammer your email list every other month with a new launch, for example, it could create launch fatigue and shrink your list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evergreen courses can bring in <strong>passive income</strong> without much work. If marketed appropriately, folks can find your course at any time and enroll, as long as your course content is continually useful to your audience segment. You’ll see money coming in each month steadily, but perhaps not in lump sums like an open/close model. In an evergreen launch, there’s no feast / famine dynamic.</p>



<h2 id="h-learner-experience">Learner Experience</h2>



<p>An open/clouse launch style is often a <strong>more hands-on</strong> course. Typically, open/close launch courses run at fixed periods and may be more likely to have harder deadlines and due dates. There will likely be more of a sense of a cohort and higher levels of interaction. This can help increase student success and completion rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evergreen courses are typically <strong>self-paced</strong>, requiring learners to depend on their own motivation to finish. For example, if you have an employee training course that can be taken anytime, it makes perfect sense to forgo an open/close type of launch and keep the course open consistently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-decide-your-launch-strategy">How to Decide Your Launch Strategy</h2>



<p>Consider each variable: learner experience, potential earnings, and marketing effort. Your decisions in each of these categories will likely sway you in a certain direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you can justify answers for both models, then <strong>try both!</strong> Start with an open/close launch a few times, then transition into an evergreen approach as your content continues to prove its value over time. This method allows you to sort through issues and improve your course along the way until you’re ready to go evergreen.</p>



<p>No matter which method you decide, LearnDash works well with evergreen or open/close courses. Experiment with both launch types by exploring the <a href="http://demo.learndash.com">LearnDash demo</a> both as a learner and a course creator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you sell content or products on your WordPress site, then you know how important it is to get your online shop set up just right. Even the slightest delay or error in a check-out process can deter a potential customer. This is especially true if you’ve created a storefront on a custom-built WordPress site – your checkout experience needs to be seamless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, there’s a popular plugin in the WordPress world called <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> that serves as the gold standard for WordPress shops and checkout solutions. WooCommerce unlocks the ability to turn your website into an online shop, allowing you to sell products, collect payments, and let customers manage accounts.</p>



<p>If you sell courses, using WooCommerce as your storefront is one of the simplest decisions you can make, but there are a few considerations before you move ahead. Let’s explore when it makes sense to use WooCommerce.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-reasons-to-use-woocommerce-for-selling-courses">Reasons to use WooCommerce for selling courses</h3>



<p>WooCommerce has become the go-to storefront on WordPress because it offers <a href="https://woocommerce.com/features/">robust features</a>. Considering how specific features will meet your needs can help you determine if it’s the right option for selling your course. Here’s why you might want to use it:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Use any payment gateway</strong>: One of the biggest strengths of WooCommerce is the vast number of payment options available. LearnDash is already integrated with Paypal, Razorpay, and Stripe. If you’d like to use another payment gateway, there are <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/">100+ payment gateways</a> available for WooCommerce— more than any other ecommerce plugin.</p>



<p><strong>Tons of customization</strong>: WooCommerce lets you customize to your heart’s content and control the way customers experience purchasing your course. You can easily add discounts, coupons, and course bundles and packages.&nbsp;Plus, there are <em>thousands</em> of extensions available for shipping, marketing, automation, payments, social media, and anything else you can imagine. We like combining WooCommerce with <a href="https://iconicwp.com/">IconicWP</a>, which is a plugin that helps you create a fast and profitable ecommerce store without any technical knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>Sell physical goods along with courses</strong>: Since WooCommerce allows you to sell any product, you can also list physical products for sale along with your courses. For instance, you can also sell T-shirts or merchandise to not only add a passive income stream but to create a community of fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The LearnDash WooCommerce integration is popular because it provides enormous flexibility. If you’re looking to build the ultimate custom ecommerce experience, play around with WooCommerce as you build your storefront. </p>

</div></figure>



<h3 id="h-reasons-not-to-use-woocommerce">Reasons <em>not</em> to use WooCommerce</h3>



<p>While it is incredibly powerful, WooCommerce does come with more of a learning curve than most other plugins and integrations. You might not want to use WooCommerce for LearnDash if:</p>



<p><strong>You’re looking for a quick and easy setup</strong>: Loads of customization options can also add confusion. If you’re looking for a super simple setup to get going immediately, you might find WooCommerce slowing you down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You have limited courses with a small audience</strong>: One of the best perks of WooCommerce is automation. But if you prefer to manage a small learner group manually, you may find you don’t need all of WooCommerce’s extra features.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You’re concerned about site speed</strong>: If you don’t have premium hosting and you’re worried about site speed, keep in mind that WooCommerce is a huge plugin that takes up space on a website. You could potentially face unnecessary slowdowns with all of WooCommerce’s features.</p>



<p>If you’re offering a straightforward checkout experience without extra bells and whistles, you may want to stick with a smaller, simpler ecommerce solution.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-the-best-of-both-worlds-woocommerce-with-learndash-cloud">The best of both worlds: WooCommerce with LearnDash Cloud</h3>



<p>If you’re ready to harness the power of both WooCommerce and LearnDash, you can get started one of two ways: WooCommerce works with both the LearnDash plugin as well as LearnDash Cloud.</p>



<ul><li>If you’re looking to integrate WooCommerce into your existing LearnDash site, our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/woocommerce/">knowledgebase</a> article walks you through how to do this.</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you’re setting up a new course site, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/learndash-cloud/">LearnDash Cloud</a> makes it easy to hit the ground running with WooCommerce. During set-up, you have the option to install WooCommerce right away as you configure your LearnDash Cloud website. This is a big perk if you already know you’d like to use a payment gateway other than Stripe upon setup. You can also rest easy knowing that your premium LearnDash Cloud hosting provides the speed you need to efficiently run WooCommerce on your site.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Ready to try out LearnDash with WooCommerce? Give the <a href="https://demo.learndash.com/courses/basic-learndash-overview/">LearnDash Demo</a> a spin to see how our plugin works from a user&#8217;s perspective. Then, sign up for your own demo website with WooCommerce pre-installed to play in a sandbox environment.</p>

<p>Before creating your first online course, you might be thinking: <em>will anyone want to buy this?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Determining if there’s a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-tips-for-determining-if-your-online-course-has-a-market/">market for your course</a> is an important first step in the creation process. The best way to do this is to conduct market research. Market research helps you understand who might want your course and ensure there’s enough demand.</p>



<p>Market research also helps you write content specifically tailored to your audience. Because of this, it’s important to perform market research early, preferrably in the ideation stage. The more you know about your market, the more you can speak to their specific pain points. Plus, the more useful and attractive your content becomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to start conducting market research for your online course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-determine-your-course-idea">Determine your course idea&nbsp;</h2>



<p>First thing, ask yourself: “is my course worth creating?” The hard truth is that your original idea may be wrong. Thankfully, you can use hard data to answer this question instead of relying on your own inner critic. Here are a few tools to help:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Check course marketplace sites. </strong>Exploring<strong> </strong>sites like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> can help you figure out how your online course fits into the broader market. Udemy lets you browse popular topics within subjects like business, design, marketing, and more. Check to see how extensively your course subject is already offered and which topics are most popular and trending.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Perform keyword research. </strong>There are a bevy of tools available for keyword research. Sites like <a href="https://sparktoro.com/product/dashboard">Sparktoro</a> can help you search what your audience is frequently talking about online. See what results come up to make sure your course topic is not only relevant but necessary.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Stay up-to-date.</strong>&nbsp; Read industry news, blogs, and articles within your niche so that your course reflects the newest and latest within your subject field. Additionally, by staying up to date, you may find a new segment of the market who needs your online course.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-create-a-learner-persona">Create a Learner Persona</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://www.td.org/atd-blog/how-to-develop-learner-personas-for-effective-training">learner persona</a> is a similar concept to a buyer persona. It’s a representation of a potential student who may enroll in your course. The benefit of a learner persona is to get in the mind of your learner to find out what they would need from an online course. This single persona serves to represent the target market and can help focus your guidelines for developing an effective course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some key characteristics to fill out for your learner persona:</p>



<ul>
<li>Demographics (don’t forget to give your persona a name, too)&nbsp;</li>



<li>Their comfort level with the material (beginner, intermediate, expert, etc)&nbsp;</li>



<li>Their pain points and goals within your niche. For example, are they looking for self-improvement, or to build on the skills learned in your course for their own business ventures?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Their level of technical ability. How streamlined should your own course be for their sake?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Conceptualizing your learner as a real person can help make sure you’re talking and writing like a human, both within your course as well as your marketing material.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-send-out-a-survey">Send Out a Survey</h2>



<p>Surverys can provide some quick feedback on how likely your audience would be to take your online course. Before sending out a survey, consider first your newly-created learner persona. Can you segment your market into a smaller group that fits the description of your learner persona? Send those folks the survey first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s an idea of what you can ask users in a survey:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>If they’ve ever taken an online course&nbsp;</li>



<li>If they’ve taken a course, if the content was useful&nbsp;</li>



<li>How much they paid or would be willing to pay for an online course</li>



<li>If you offered a course on a chosen topic, would they take it?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>LearnDash integrates with SurveyMonkey for an automated process with a variety of trigger settings. For example, if a user enrolls in a course (even a free sample course), you can set up an automation to email your new learner with a survey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, you can always create a generic survey before getting into LearnDash by using <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/">SurveyMonkey</a> or your favorite survey tool, such as <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/forms/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-dr-1011401&amp;utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_595123210492-ADGP_Desk%20%7C%20BKWS%20-%20EXA%20%7C%20Txt%20~%20Forms_Google%20Forms-KWID_43700063921124670-kwd-299031573119&amp;utm_term=KW_google%20forms%20survey-ST_google%20forms%20survey&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwsMGYBhAEEiwAGUXJaXgx4FPpy2hwcKmcjpDbhMeUXBxGute_xhyEsQHUWwcCBkMX0iorrRoC24sQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Google Forms</a>. You can even send out tailored buyer persona surveys using templates via tools like <a href="https://survicate.com/survey-templates/buyer-persona-survey/">Survicate</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-check-out-the-competition">Check Out the Competition</h2>



<p>Once you’ve done some research on the marketplace and your audience, you’ll want to narrow your scope and look directly at your competitors. Start by making a list of who your course competes with for attention. Then, write down how they describe their course. Finally, compare&nbsp; your course idea and see what makes yours unique. The more you stand out from the crowd, you more you may pique learner’s interest.</p>



<p>Another helpful tool can be to perform a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp">SWOT analysis</a> of competitors. A SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Growth) is a tried and true business strategy for planning and execution. You’ve likely already done this for your own course and brand, but have you considered your competitors from a SWOT analysis standpoint? You may learn that an area of weakness from your competitors is a potential opportunity for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-create-an-action-plan">Create an Action Plan</h2>



<p>With the knowledge gleaned from examining the market, creating a learner persona and a survey, and analyzing the competition, you can form an action plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In your action plan, identify:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Your overall goal for the course</li>



<li>Your next steps&nbsp;</li>



<li>Your priorities organized by importance&nbsp;</li>



<li>Solutions to any problems you’ve identified</li>



<li>Due dates for deliverables (and your course going live!)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Remember, no amount of market research will give you a perfect answer as to whether your online course will be successful. However, conducting market research will help you determine if your course has a chance. In the end, you still need to execute properly if you want to start and grow an online course business.</p>

<p>What you call your course matters. After all, not only does your course name indicate the subject matter but like any good book, titles entice the user to learn more.</p>



<p>As you know, online audiences have short attention spans and often make snap decisions based on a quick first impression. Most folks only stay on a web page for about 15 seconds, so if the name of your course doesn’t grab their attention, they may click elsewhere for content that seems more worth their time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help you think more critically about what to call your class, we’ve gathered six reasons why we think it’s important to have this conversation about your course name.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-your-course-appears-more-professional-when-branded">Your course appears more professional when branded</h3>



<p>If you’ve named courses before, bring the title to mind: how does the name reflect on your brand? Does the phrasing, wording, imaging, and banners all show the learner what your company is about? Everyone should think of how their course reflects on their brand. By using language you would use to describe your overall company aesthetic, you’re ensuring that your course is an extension of what you offer as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-a-good-course-name-allows-for-specific-design-elements">A good course name allows for specific design elements&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The more specific and focused your course name is, the more you can use it as a design framework. For example, instead of offering an “introduction to photography” course, your customers can say they enrolled in a “photography bootcamp” or “photography academy.” That sort of branding unlocks tons of potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a bootcamp, for example, you can refer to lesson elements as “stations” where learners stop and practice a new skill. Learners can run “drills” (quizzes) to test their knowledge. With a focused, tailored title, it unlocks more potential for creative, unified, and specific course design.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-seo-best-practices-can-attract-more-users">SEO best practices can attract more users&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you hope to grow traffic to your courses organically, you should be following <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-tips-to-build-seo-strength-for-your-online-course/">SEO (search engine optimization) best practices</a>. We have some specific tips for course creation SEO from <a href="https://www.learndash.com/using-seo-to-sell-more-online-courses/">Rebecca Gill that can help you sell your courses</a>. Tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a> help you find phrases, keywords, and search terms for a course name, along with how difficult it would be to rank each option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also run potential name ideas through <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=CA">Google Trends</a>. This free service can help you identify search volume patterns as well as related search queries and topics. For example, if you search “how to vlog” in Google Trends, you’ll see the related topics are “YouTube” and “TikTok.” So, if you tailored a class especially for “how to vlog on TikTok,” you may hit a niche market where more folks will be interested in your course!&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-it-sets-you-apart-from-competitors">It sets you apart from competitors&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This is one of the most important ideas behind why it’s important to think about your course title. Potential learners need to see right in the title that what you offer differs from your competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s think back to the photography bootcamp example. If your course fully embraces this concept of a “bootcamp” then over time, your course may be known among competitors as an intensive crash course on the subject. Other interested folks will start to recognize that your course design is different than any other basic course model and will gravitate towards your course as having a perceived benefit over the competition. All of this begins with a name!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-a-course-name-has-to-mean-something">A course name has to &#8220;mean&#8221; something</h3>



<p>One big mistake in naming courses is falling into the trap of being too cute or clever. Puns, acronyms, and other turns of phrases are fun and exciting to brainstorm, but at the end of the day, they are often empty cliches that don’t mean much. Relying too much on a pun can even mislead potential learners or turn them off. Clarity should beat cleverness every time.</p>



<h3 id="h-it-sets-expectations-for-the-learners">It sets expectations for the learners&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Similar to specificity for SEO purposes, specificity in your name should also address pain points your course is going to solve. One way to think about this is to answer the question:&nbsp; “What is the value of my course?” Most often, this goes back to learning outcomes, which are the objectives you want your learners to take away from the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s think back to the vlogging example. “How to vlog,” doesn’t quite mean anything. “How to vlog on TikTok” is better, but what are learners really taking away? “From Beginner to Pro: How to vlog on TikTok” explains a bit more the value of your course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What folks are buying is a <em>transformation</em>. A great course name should set the expectation for how much work is ahead of them while also hinting at the benefits. How will your course make their lives better?&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>With these considerations in mind, we hope you agree that it’s important to think deeply about what goes into your next course name. No matter how great your content, if the name doesn’t hint or showcase this, you might never entice folks enough to check it out.</p>

<p>If you plan to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-course-pricing-models-explained/">charge a premium for your course</a>, you must ensure the experience lives up to the price tag. That could mean offering a little something extra to help students justify the cost.</p>



<p>At a minimum, your course should provide top-notch content and a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-organize-your-online-course-content/">seamless student interface</a>. But you can also include a few extras to incentivize learners to sign up for your course. Here are five options to consider if you’re looking for ways to justify a higher course price and sweeten the deal for students.</p>



<h2>1. Share downloadable bonus content.</h2>



<p>People love a useful freebie. Templates, spreadsheets, worksheets, and other <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/ideas-to-use-pdf-in-elearning">downloadable goodies</a> provide value by helping students jump-start a project or apply course lessons to their specific needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The type of freebie you offer will depend on your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-choose-a-topic-for-your-course-in-a-saturated-market/">course topic</a>. For example, if your course is about personal finance, you might give away a convenient budgeting spreadsheet to students who enroll.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. Recruit a well-known instructor.</h2>



<p>You don’t need an A-list celebrity as the face of your course, but it helps to have a recognizable and reputable instructor. Prospective students will be more willing to pay a higher price if they’re confident in the teacher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure you—or whoever is teaching your course—is respected in your field and has relevant credentials. Highlight those credentials in your course description and emphasize your street cred wherever it’s relevant.</p>



<h2>3. Offer one-on-one coaching.</h2>



<p>Sometimes, online learning can feel a little impersonal—especially if students don’t receive individual attention from the instructor. Add a personal and premium touch to your course by offering one-on-one coaching to each student who signs up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might offer a 30-minute phone session with each student, for example, or you could offer in-depth, personalized feedback on one of the course assignments.</p>



<h2>4. Create a community.</h2>



<p>For some learners, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/creating-a-robust-social-community-within-your-lms/">connecting with other students</a> is just as valuable as a qualified instructor and one-on-one coaching. Make it easy for learners to network with each other by providing a private community just for class participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can use an add-on like <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/restrict-content-pro/">Restrict Content Pro</a> to keep this community in a gated section of your website. You can also opt for a platform like Google Groups or Facebook Groups if that’s where your students prefer to interact.</p>



<h2>5. Provide certification.</h2>



<p>You can justify charging a little more for your course if it offers a worthwhile certification. This may require some extra work on your end to coordinate with the governing body or association for your industry, but it can be worth the extra effort to provide this added value to your learners—and give your course’s credibility a boost.</p>



<h2 id="h-justify-a-higher-course-price-with-learndash">Justify a higher course price with LearnDash.</h2>



<p>If you’re ready to create a high-ticket course, the capability of your course platform must also match the price. LearnDash was created by educators for course creators. That means we understand all the tools your students need to succeed, which include advanced quizzing to gauge learning retention, focus mode for distraction-free learning, leaderboards for gamification, and more!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emails are a valuable tool for your business. These aren’t only a way of communicating with customers, but also an excellent channel to get the word out to prospects about your services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies use email marketing to:</p>



<ul><li>Inform their customers with news and updates about the business</li></ul>



<ul><li>Attract potential clients with new service offerings and discounts</li><li>Engage readers and motivate them to get to know the brand better</li><li>Convert prospects into buyers and retain current customers</li></ul>



<p>To master your email marketing strategy, you must know how to write high-performing emails.</p>



<p>Experts agree personalization is key to building an email that engages and converts. Consider adding a unique opening to your message and multimedia elements to get customers’ attention.</p>

<p>The first step to organizing and promoting your online course with email marketing is to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-email-list-building-strategies-for-course-creators/">build an email list</a>.</p>



<p>On this list, you’ll add the customer&#8217;s email addresses to whom you want to sell your online course. Once you’ve done it, you can send a mass email to your contacts and get them to enroll in your training program.</p>



<p>How can you build your email list fast and from scratch? Follow these tips and upgrade your list-building strategy:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Collect emails ethically and effectively — </strong>one thing you don’t want to do when building an email list is to be intrusive. Use embedded signup forms on your website to gather visitors’ data or build a strong customer referral program.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Collect the data you need — </strong>think about what kind of information you need from your customers. Design sign-up forms accordingly and keep them short. Ask people to fill in 1-3 fields to avoid form abandonment.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Create useful content — </strong>update your content regularly and diversify your communications. Clients may get tired of receiving the same promotional email over and over again. Instead, offer them another type of content like blog articles, online courses or monthly newsletters.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Measure the results — </strong>check metrics like the click-to-open and conversion rates. Like this, you can analyze if your email marketing strategy is working as expected and how many people are subscribing to your course.</li></ul>

<p>To <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-price-an-online-course/">sell your online course</a> you must know how to write a killer email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s no magical formula to building a perfect email, but there are some steps you can follow to drive more conversions:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Write an eye-catching subject — </strong>create a sense of urgency and inspire curiosity in your audience. E.g., ‘Don’t miss out on a once in a lifetime opportunity to enroll in our online course’ or ‘Are you ready to change your career path?’.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Customize every email — </strong>call readers by their name, but also send them relevant content depending on their buying preferences. You can get these insights if you track your email marketing campaign performance.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Create engaging and shareable content — </strong>design a high-converting copy. You may offer the best online course ever, but if you don’t know how to sell it with words you’re lost. Use your brand’s tone of voice and be straightforward with your message.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Add a powerful CTA — </strong>drive users to take action and buy your online course. Place a CTA button or link at the end of the email to guide customers to a landing page. Command verbs like ‘subscribe’ or ‘register now’ work best.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Close the email with your email signature — </strong>be professional. An email signature shows you&#8217;re an established business and it reinforces interaction with the reader.</li></ul>



<p>If you use these hints, you’ll be one step closer to attracting customers to your online course. Your clients appreciate concision. Make sure to keep your email short and communicate your message as clearly as possible.</p>

<figure class="alignright"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/reading-at-computer-300x171.jpg" alt="Woman deciding on her online course pricing." class="wp-image-11206"/></figure></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing can be one of the trickiest parts of launching a new course. It requires a balance between providing value to your audience and setting a price they’re willing to pay—or deciding if you’re going to charge for your courses at all.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you choose a course pricing model, it’s a good idea to compare the options and consider your revenue goals. Here are the four most common pricing models to consider as you plan and price your courses.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-1-free-courses">1. Free courses</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-free-course-content-to-drive-more-business/">Free courses</a> are a great tool to help drive business and get people interested in the content you have to offer. A free course or sample lesson can also serve as a test strategy for something you plan to evolve or further develop as a paid course later. If you’re just beginning to cultivate your audience, a free course can be a good starting point as you build up a customer base.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-baseline-courses">2. Baseline courses</h2>



<p>Baseline courses reach a wide audience by providing content that appeals to many people at an affordable price point. These should be courses that you can create relatively quickly. They also shouldn’t require a huge time commitment from students or cover topics that are too in-depth or technical. These courses may result in a lot of signups with lower participation because of the low-risk price point.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-small-font-size"><blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="https://www.learndash.com/do-low-online-course-completion-rates-matter/"><strong>Do Low Online Course Completion Rates Matter?</strong></a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>3. Premium courses</h2>



<p>Premium online courses are the goal for most content creators when they are thinking about pricing strategy. These courses have the highest price points and deliver quality, in-depth content. Course material must be unique, taught by a reputable or well-known instructor, or cover a subject that you won’t find anywhere else—these attributes help justify the premium price point.</p>



<h2>4. Subscription courses</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/should-you-use-a-subscription-pricing-strategy/">Subscription model courses</a> offer membership payment options for your customers. This can be in the form of daily, weekly, monthly, or annual subscriptions. After becoming a member, students have unlimited access to your gated course content.</p>



<p>Regardless of which pricing model you choose, how can you be sure you’re setting the right price for your courses?</p>



<h2>The formula for setting your course price</h2>



<p>Setting the price for a course isn’t an exact science, but you can use the formula below to take some of the guesswork out of pricing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-price-an-online-course/"><strong>How to Price an Online Course</strong></a></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>To get started, you’ll need a few key pieces of information.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Audience size. </strong>Take a look at your audience to determine how many people might be interested in your online course. You might start by adding up your total followers on social media or looking at the size of your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-email-list-building-strategies-for-course-creators/">email list</a>. If you’re creating a course on a niche topic, your potential audience may be a smaller segment of your larger audience. The audience size might change for every new course you create.</li><li><strong>Revenue goals. </strong>Think about <a href="https://www.learnworlds.com/how-much-money-can-you-make-selling-online-courses/">how much you want or need to earn</a> from the course. Do you need to cover costs to break even? Do you have an income goal? What is the total amount of revenue you expect to earn?</li><li><strong>Conversion. </strong>How many people in your potential audience do you expect to actually purchase the course? Using data from your email list, social media following, landing pages, or other campaign information, you can come up with an estimated conversion rate for your audience. This rate should be a percentage represented in a decimal: For example, if you expect 10% of your audience to convert, use 0.10 in the formula below.</li></ul>



<p>Now you’re ready to try out the formula:</p>



<p><strong>Revenue = Audience Size x Conversion Rate x Price</strong></p>



<p>Plug in different numbers to see how the course price changes based on your revenue goals, or how revenue increases or decreases at different course price points and conversion rates.</p>



<p>The optimal course price is one that allows you to meet your revenue goals given your audience size and estimated conversion rate.</p>



<h2>Reach your goals while staying grounded</h2>



<p>The final element of pricing strategy is ensuring that course content aligns with the price. If you use the formula and it suggests an exorbitant course price, you might need to reconsider your goals; it’s unreasonable to charge $10,000 for 10 minutes of information, for example.</p>



<p>Ultimately, thinking about the different pricing models with the pricing formula as a guide will help you choose a pricing strategy that works for you and for your customer base.</p>

<p>Content is done, promotions are ready, and the last item on your pre-launch checklist is how to price an online course so that people will sign up. Pricing can be one of the trickiest elements of launching a new course online because it is a balance of finding that sweet spot of providing value to your target audience at a price they’re willing to pay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appropriate online course building and pricing can help a content creator make the move from a side gig to full-time work. Well-developed online courses can drive revenue and even sponsorships for your website or brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to get started? Here are some pricing considerations to think about before launching a new online course.</p>



<h2 id="h-pricing-online-courses-starts-with-course-types"><strong>Pricing Online Courses Starts with Course Types</strong></h2>



<p>Online course expert <a href="https://sarahcordiner.com/price-online-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Cordiner</a> says that all content falls into one of five types of online courses. Of course, the type you plan to offer can correlate to value and pricing strategy. It’s important for content creators to keep this in mind as they develop online courses.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Lead Magnet Mini-Course:</strong> Generally, this is a free and short online course that helps get people interested in greater content. The mini-course may be the first lesson of a more comprehensive paid course that serves as a marketing lead.</li><li><strong>Kickstarter Course:</strong> These courses are a gateway for content creators into course development. These online courses might mimic other content you are creating, such as a how-to blog post series, in a different format. These courses are often low-priced (less than $100), aren’t long in duration (can be completed in a few minutes to an hour), and are ideal for creators that already have credibility and followers.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Authority Flagship Course:</strong> When you think of online courses, the Authority Flagship Model is probably what comes to mind first. These are courses with an established instructor that’s got plenty of credibility in their field, are moderately priced ($100 to $3,000), and include repeat logins or sessions (lasting about one hour each over several weeks). These courses include information that you can’t get elsewhere, such as a tutorial or in-depth explainer of a topic.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supportive Coach-Lead Course:</strong> The content may be similar to an Authority Flagship Course, but the delivery is different. These courses are designed for self-study and independent, rather than mass, learning with touchpoints with the instructor. These online courses are higher-priced ($500 and up), include multiple sessions and one-on-one meetings, and plenty of information to help you succeed individually.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Membership or Online Academy Course:</strong> This group class is structured with multiple classes in a series that build on one another. Students might participate in different tracks to earn credentials or certifications. The pricing strategy is less about the cost of an individual course, but for the module as a whole using a subscription-based model ($10 to $100 per month).&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>No matter which online course strategy you choose, you need to <a href="https://myelearningworld.com/how-to-price-your-online-course/">do your homework</a> to ensure that you are developing a course that people will want to take. It starts with research, audience understanding, marketing, and content development.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-pricing-models-for-online-courses"><strong>4 Pricing Models for Online Courses</strong></h2>



<p>Once you have developed a course and know what type of class you’ll offer, it’s time to really start thinking about pricing. There are four true tiers of online course pricing: free, baseline, and premium.</p>



<h3 id="h-free-courses">Free courses</h3>



<p>Free courses are a great tool to help drive business and get people interested in the course content you have to offer. A <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-free-course-content-to-drive-more-business/">free course</a> or sample lesson can also serve as a test strategy for something you plan to evolve or further develop as a paid course later.</p>



<h3 id="h-baseline-courses">Baseline courses</h3>



<p>Baseline courses reach a wide audience with content that appeals to a lot of people at an economical price point. These courses should be quick to create, not involve huge participant time commitments, and include topics or information that goes in-depth, but doesn’t get too technical. These courses may result in a lot of signups with low participation because of the low-risk price point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you give a coupon for a free class, the completion rate can be in the low single digits. When you charge for the same course, the completion rate can be 30% or 40%. The more you charge for a course, the more people actually complete it,” <a href="https://convertkit.com/how-to-price-your-online-course">said Ankur Nagpal, CEO and founder of Teachable</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-premium-courses">Premium courses</h3>



<p>Premium online courses are the goal for most content creators when they are thinking about pricing strategy. These courses have the highest price points but must deliver high-quality content at the same time. Course material must be unique, have a well-known instructor, or be something that you can’t get anywhere else to justify the price point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of a premium online course as being on par with a university-level experience or led by a “celebrity” in a masterclass format. These courses won’t garner as many signups as baseline courses but often have high participation and engagement rates.</p>



<h3>Subscription model</h3>



<p>Subscription model courses offer membership payment options for your customers. This can be in the form of daily, weekly, monthly, or annual subscriptions. Once a member, your customer gets access to your gated content.</p>



<h2><strong>Online Course Pricing Strategy</strong></h2>



<p>One of the best formulas for pricing online courses comes from <a href="https://onlinecourseigniter.com/how-much-money-can-you-make-from-an-online-course/">Online Course Igniter</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It starts with a little audience research so that you know how many people could potentially be interested in your online course. This audience could change for every new course, depending on the content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, you’ll want to think about how much money you want or need to make from the course. Do you have costs that you need to cover to break even? Do you have a set goal for income from each online course?</p>



<p>Then you are going to take a deep dive into your audience analytics. At this point, you probably have an email list, social media following, landing page, or another method to collect and interact with people who are interested in your content. What you need to determine is how interested they are to come up with an average conversion rate for that audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then you can plug all the data into the basic formula to determine pricing and revenue:</p>



<p><strong>Revenue = Audience Size x Conversion Rate x Price</strong></p>



<p>Don’t forget to subtract any costs from revenue to <a href="https://www.learnworlds.com/how-much-money-can-you-make-selling-online-courses/">determine actual profit</a> on the online courses you create.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final element of pricing strategy is ensuring that course content aligns with the price. It’s unreasonable to ask someone to pay $1,000 for 10 minutes of information. Thinking about pricing models and perceived value will help you choose a pricing strategy that works for your customer base.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Much Should You Charge for an Online Course?</strong></h2>



<p>So, it all comes back to the central question: How much should you charge for an online course?</p>



<p>Thinking about course type, pricing models, and then a full pricing strategy the answer may be more clear than you think. (You should at least narrow it to a range quickly.)</p>

<p>Creating your online course is only the first step of the journey.</p>



<p>You’ve spent good money and tons of hours to create a valuable course for your audience, but now, <em>how will you sell that course?</em></p>



<p>As a course creator, there are a few areas of marketing that are going to be crucial to the success of your online course.</p>



<p><em>SEO.</em></p>



<p><em>Content creation.</em></p>



<p><em>Email marketing.</em></p>



<p>But<strong> your email list is</strong> <strong>your bread and butter.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s where you capture and own your audience. Where you develop long-term relationships with your audience.&nbsp; Where you build trust with people.</p>



<p><em>And it’s where most people are likely to buy from you.</em> The best time to start your email list was a year ago, and the second-best time to start is NOW.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll dig into 7 ways you, as a course creator, can start growing your email list. Each of these 7 tactics we consider to be “lead generation tactics” and work best if followed up with an automated welcome sequence or sales sequence.</p>



<p>So why are these “lead generation tactics” so important for course creators?</p>



<p>Believe it or not, not everyone who lands on your website is ready to buy from you. Even those who are very interested in your course!</p>



<p>Most of the time, it takes a bit of nurturing and trust-building for folks to buy your courses or products. Your email list is the place where all of that happens!</p>



<p>And the best part?</p>



<p>When you create new courses or products, run special offers, or have new announcements — your email list is a captive audience of raving fans.</p>



<p>So let’s jump into these 7 Email List Building Tactics, so you can start selling more of your course!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-give-away-the-first-video-of-your-course-for-free"><strong>1. Give away the first video of your course…for free.</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s just go ahead and start with a bang.</p>



<p>Overcoming objections is a very common tactic in sales, and if you’re going to sell more of your course, you’ll need to anticipate your audience’s objections and head them off.</p>



<p>OBJECTION: If people are hesitant to buy your online course, it’s quite possible that they simply aren’t sure that the course is exactly what they need.</p>



<p>Giving away the first video of the course for free is a fantastic way to <strong>overcome that objection</strong> and show people that your course is <em>exactly the thing they need</em> to solve whatever problem they’re experiencing.</p>



<p>Or, it proves that the course isn’t what they need.</p>



<p>Either way, by giving away the first part of your course for free, you become etched as a trustworthy and generous brand in the mind of your audience — and that goes a long way.</p>



<p>P.S. If you’re worried about giving too much away for free, remember that the first video of your course is only a sample. It’s likely that they can’t really do anything without the entire course curriculum, right?</p>



<p>So be generous and give that first video away. I think you’ll be surprised to see the amount of sales that roll in from this little trick.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-create-a-free-video-course"><strong>2. Create a free video course.</strong></h3>



<p><em>MORE free stuff?!</em> You better believe it. Anyone who has been to Costco on a Sunday knows that we love freebies.</p>



<p>But before you get too worked up about creating ANOTHER course (and giving it away for free nonetheless), let me explain a little.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>*This free course does not have to be highly produced, and it doesn’t have to be long.*</strong></p>



<p>It just has to be valuable, aligned with your audience’s aspirational identity, and delivered via email over a set number of days.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.brandbuildersgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brand Builders Group</a> does a great job with this in their free course <a href="http://firststeptofamous.com/jf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“First Step to Famous.”</a></p>



<p>When someone opts in for the free course, they immediately receive the first video of the series in their inbox.</p>



<p>Then, over the next few days, the rest of the free course is delivered via email one video per day, with each video creating enough intrigue to prompt viewers back to the inbox the next day.</p>



<p>And at the end of the free video series?</p>



<p>You pitch your paid course, of course.</p>



<p>The benefits of giving away a free course are enormous. Not only is it attractive for your audience to get free content, in the process you simultaneously build trust with your audience AND you subconsciously train them to look for value every time they see your name pop up in the inbox.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-give-away-a-cheatsheet-or-checklist"><strong>3. Give away a “Cheatsheet” or “Checklist”.</strong></h3>



<p>I think classic whitepapers and PDFs are dying out. BUT…this does not mean that downloadable offers are irrelevant.</p>



<p>With so much information readily available from a quick Google search, we are less likely to give up our email addresses for information.</p>



<p><strong>We will, however, give up an email address for organization and application</strong>.</p>



<p>When you create a downloadable offer, make sure that it’s something your prospects can actually use. If your offer is just information, there’s a solid chance it will collect dust in the back corners of their Macbook.</p>



<p>Checklists and cheatsheets are two great ways to compile useful information into something more tangible.</p>



<p>Think “The Project Manager’s Ultimate Kickoff Meeting Checklist”, or “The Mama’s Cheatsheet to Daytime Naps”.</p>



<p>Instead of just giving information, create an offer that will be used daily and that is not likely to be found in a quick Google search.</p>



<p>Set up your Cheatsheet or Checklist with a pop up on your website and watch the leads roll in!</p>



<h3 id="h-4-start-a-newsletter"><strong>4. Start A Newsletter.</strong></h3>



<p>“Newsletters are dead, Jeff.”</p>



<p>False &amp; erroneous. Newsletters that just talk about your company ARE dead. Newsletters that talk about the reader are NOT.</p>



<p>A common mistake that people make with email newsletters is turning them into company bulletin boards.</p>



<p><em>“Check out our company picnic.</em></p>



<p><em>Here are our new hires.<br>Here’s a word from our president.”</em></p>



<p>I agree, nobody gives a rip about those newsletters.</p>



<p><strong><em>What people will sign up for, however, is regular content that makes their lives better.</em></strong></p>



<p>Enter the lead generating newsletter.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoolist.com/best-newsletters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brands like these ones&nbsp;</a>are roping in new subscribers by the thousands to their daily, weekly, or monthly newsletters.</p>



<p>The keys to creating a successful newsletter, though, are that the theme has to <strong>be aspirational to the audience it&#8217;s trying to reach</strong>, and the <strong>content has to be extremely valuable</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, creating a desirable newsletter such as this requires an intimate knowledge of your audience.</p>



<p>The better you know your target audience, the more likely you can strike gold with a regular newsletter that <em>your prospects can’t wait to sign up for.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-5-create-a-quiz"><strong>5. Create a Quiz.</strong></h3>



<p>Quizzes have long been known as effective lead generators. But the statistics are truly staggering.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActiveCampaign</a> found that quizzes can generate up to <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/5-secrets-to-using-quizzes-lead-generation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25x more leads</a> than a standard popup offering a PDF!</p>



<p>Similar to the newsletter, quizzes that tap into an aspirational identity with the target audience perform even better.</p>



<p>We are naturally curious and love to learn new things about ourselves and quizzes allow us to do that.</p>



<p>The brilliance of including a quiz as part of your lead generation strategy is that it creates an environment of engagement right from the get-go.</p>



<p>The more you engage your audience at the beginning of your relationship with them, the more likely it is that they will continue to engage with your brand in the future and respond to well-targeted offers.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-put-on-a-webinar"><strong>6. Put on a Webinar.</strong></h3>



<p>Webinars have quickly become one of the more popular lead generation tools in the last few years.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because they’re interactive, they establish you as a trusted authority, and <em>the leads are usually pretty warm</em>.</p>



<p>As the e-learning market grows, the amount of time we spend consuming webinars has <a href="https://on24.drift.click/c053a93b-23d9-42c6-b0e9-e92d536977a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased nearly 3x</a>, as well.</p>



<p>Webinars work especially well for launching a new course. According to Podia, 53% of marketers say that webinars generate the most high quality top-of-funnel leads, and as many as 40% of webinar attendees become qualified leads.</p>



<p>These are significant numbers, and prove how highly effective webinars can be to selling your new courses right out of the gate.</p>



<p>When your new course is ready to launch, set up a free webinar to introduce the course, teach a section of the course, or teach something related to the course topic.</p>



<p>Then, broadcast an announcement for the webinar across your social channels and on your website to invite people to attend.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-offer-a-discount"><strong>7. Offer a Discount.</strong></h3>



<p>I don’t recommend a discount for everyone, and some brands just aren’t into that kind of thing.</p>



<p><em>The only times</em> I would really suggest a discount is the launch of your brand, the launch of a new course, or around special holidays.</p>



<p>Needless to say…</p>



<p>Discounts have a way of piquing our interest and introducing a sense of urgency in a way that nothing else can.</p>



<p>It’s a double-edged sword, though. If you offer discounts too often, they just become noise and people will start to expect discounts or wait for your next discount to purchase your courses.</p>



<p>When you need a little momentum, say at the launch of a course, offering a discount just might be the best way to inject a little jet fuel and get things rockin’ and rollin’.</p>



<p>Just make sure you require people to opt-in with an email address to receive the discount code!</p>



<h3 id="h-final-words"><strong>Final Words</strong></h3>



<p>Building an audience can be challenging.</p>



<p>Finding the right strategy for generating leads onto your email list sometimes takes making educated guesses and iteration after iteration.</p>



<p>You might not get it just right the first time. But the truth is, <em>one well-working funnel can change your life.</em></p>



<p>Find the right lead generation tactic that works for you, your brand, and your audience,&nbsp;</p>



<p>attach a sales sequence to it,&nbsp;and set up a monthly <a href="http://www.contentremedy.co/blog/simple-email-marketing-strategy">broadcast strategy</a> to stay top of mind with your audience.</p>

<p>Many customers expect the option to try before they buy when considering a purchase—after all, most of us wouldn’t drive off the lot in a new car without taking it for a test drive first.</p>



<p>The same can be true for students considering enrolling in your online courses. Even though <em>you </em>know your content is top-notch, a new customer might not be convinced before seeing it for themself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By offering some of your course content for free, you can give prospective students a taste of the class before they move forward with a purchase. If giving away the goods seems counterintuitive, rest assured: Offering a freebie doesn’t mean you’re leaving money on the table. In fact, it could lead to <em>more </em>revenue by attracting a greater number of students to try out your courses and ultimately make a purchase.</p>



<p>Ready to use free course content to strengthen your business and increase sales? Here are a few ways to get started.</p>



<h2 id="h-offer-a-sample-lesson"><strong>Offer a sample lesson</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s say you sell online Italian courses. Maybe a prospective student isn’t sure they’ll be self-motivated or engaged enough to stick to the lessons. By offering a sample lesson of your beginner’s course, students can make sure the class structure and approach is a good fit for the way they learn—then they’ll be ready to buy the full course.</p>



<p>With a tool like LearnDash, you can easily create free <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/sample-lessons/">sample lessons</a>. Simply toggle a switch in your lesson&nbsp; settings to open up the lesson of your choice to anyone who’s interested.</p>



<h2><strong>Unlock a paid course</strong></h2>



<p>If a sample lesson is the amuse-bouche that gives students a taste of your content, unlocking a paid course is like handing out a free lunch.</p>



<p>This generous freebie allows prospective customers to go deeper into your content than what they’d experience in a sample lesson. Maybe they even take a few <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/quizzes/">quizzes</a> and watch some video content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a robust course catalog, opening up a whole course for free can be an effective way to familiarize students with your content before they buy additional courses. This approach also works well if your courses are structured in a progression: For example, you might unlock the first course in a series, then students can purchase subsequent courses to take their knowledge to the next level.</p>



<p><strong><em>Tip: </em></strong><em>Already have a YouTube playlist that you’re ready to repackage as a free course? Use the </em><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/courses/course-create-wizard/"><em>Course Create Wizard</em></a><em> in LearnDash to create an entire course from a playlist URL.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Think beyond sales</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ungated-content-free">Gated content</a> isn’t just a marketing tool for white papers and ebooks. Whether you offer a sample lesson or an entire course for free, you can require students to register for free content. This allows you to collect their email addresses and build a high-quality <a href="https://www.learndash.com/email-marketing-best-practices-for-online-educators/">email marketing</a> list.</p>



<p>Ultimately, free course content can also generate powerful word-of-mouth marketing. You never know who might try a sample lesson and recommend your course to someone who becomes your next customer.</p>

<p><strong>Your course customers want your course but they don’t want to jump through hoops to buy it. Creating a seamless checkout experience will not only wow your customers but improve your conversion rates to increase your profits.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>At this point, you’ve probably already launched your course and you’re seeing a good amount of traffic. But that traffic isn’t translating into bigger numbers in your bank account due to an increased cart abandonment rate.</p>



<p>Currently, the <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">cart abandonment rate</a> for ecommerce sites is sitting at nearly 70% across the board with the culprit hiding within the checkout process. That sounds discouraging but there’s hope for your online courses and it starts with optimizing your sales funnel.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What’s a sales funnel?</strong></p>



<p>A sales funnel is just marketing jargon for your sales process. On the surface every ecommerce business model has a sales funnel that starts with capturing a prospective customer’s attention and nurturing them until they make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to selling your LearnDash courses, your sales funnel will need a few tweaks to create a smoother sales process for your customer that will encourage them to complete the checkout process. More checkout completions equals more conversions and that means more profits for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How to increase conversion rates on your LearnDash course checkout page with WooFunnels&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>LearnDash’s checkout process makes it super simple for your customers to checkout but sometimes you need a few extras to boost sales. This is where a sales funnel integration comes in handy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Out of the box, WooFunnels comes equipped with six pre-built pages: optin, optin confirmation,sales page,checkouts, one click upsell, and thank you pages. This makes designing your sales funnel easy so you can focus on more important things.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most important WooFunnel features.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>High-Converting Checkout Pages</strong></p>



<p>Checkout pages are fully customizable giving you the freedom to design the page however you want. It also gives you the option to create single or multi-step checkout pages.</p>



<p>The checkout experience for mobile and desktop are optimized to boost average order value (AOV). Use their order bumps feature to show unlimited&nbsp; bumps on the checkout. They can include cross-sells for faster shipping, other courses, memberships, and even subscriptions.</p>



<p><strong>One-Click Upsells</strong></p>



<p>If your course sales funnel isn’t seeing a ton of traffic, you can make the most of the traffic that you do get with upsells. You won’t even need to spend extra money on ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can set target based rules to show customers products they’re most likely to buy. This is based on the acceptance or rejection of the previous offer. Beyond the checkout page, you can even offer one click upsells to increase AOV.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Analytics &amp; Reporting</strong></p>



<p>Your funnel will continually need improving so having access to robust analytics and reporting is a huge bonus. Woofunnels reporting dashboard shows how your funnels are performing with real-time analytics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To sell courses on your WordPress site, you&#8217;ll need to choose an excellent Learning Management System (LMS) tool like LearnDash. LearnDash&#8217;s top<strong> priority is helping you easily create, manage, and sell high-quality courses. </strong></p>



<p>According to Hubspot,&nbsp;LearnDash is the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-lms-plugin">best LMS plugin for WordPress</a> so it’s no secret that we’re pretty good at what we do. But we’re always looking for better ways to deliver the best elearning tools to support our learners. This is why we recommend integrating WooCommerce with your LearnDash membership to extend your course capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll detail why the Woocommerce integration is the perfect choice to sell your courses. As a bonus, you’ll get a step-by-step walkthrough of how to install, set up, and use it for your site.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-woocommerce"><strong>What Is Woocommerce?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> is a fully customizable, WordPress plugin that allows you to convert your WordPress website into a fully functional eCommerce platform. The plugin allows you to sell anything online and that includes your LearnDash courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-3-1024x576.png" alt="How To Sell Your Online Courses With WooCommerce" class="wp-image-29668"/></figure>



<p>One of the biggest wins with WooCommerce is having the capability to build your store without restrictions on design or payment processors which makes it an ideal choice for course creators.</p>



<h2 id="h-reasons-to-use-woocommerce-with-learn-dash"><strong>Reasons To Use Woocommerce With Learn Dash</strong></h2>



<p>LearnDash is built to keep things simple for course creators but sometimes you may need more features to make your course site more robust when it comes to automation and user experience. The WooCommer plugin works as a collaborative plugin to increase the range of your LearnDash site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of WooCommerce’s most powerful features.</p>



<p><strong>Automation made simple</strong></p>



<p>For example the course <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/login-registration/learndash/">registration page for LearnDash</a> is simple enough to allow your learners to register for your course quickly. WooCommerce takes that to the next level with automatic course enrollment immediately after registering. This takes a few steps out of the registration process to improve user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, WooCommerce allows you to process automatic refunds if you should need them and automatic course removals when your learners cancel subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WooCommerce is a beast when it comes to automation and user experience and it’s the perfect addition to your LearnDash membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Extensive payment gateway options</strong></p>



<p>Out of the box, LearnDash comes equipped with a built-in payment gateway system that accepts payments from processors like Stripe or Paypal. Since WooCommerce is more focused on the “ecommerce” part it adds a ton of features to beef up the payments system on LearnDash.</p>



<p>With WooCommerce you get access to over <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=1023&amp;collections=product&amp;page=2">100+ payment gateways</a> like Apple Pay, Square, and AfterPay. This gives your prospective learners the power of choice by offering a variety of payment options.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-5-1024x576.png" alt="How To Sell Your Online Courses With WooCommerce" class="wp-image-29672"/></figure>



<p><strong>Supports physical and digital products&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Since LearnDash was created for courses, it has the best option for you to sell your digital courses with ease. When you combine it with WooCommerce, it allows you to sell physical products as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By having dual product capabilities you can better support your course community by offering more products like physical books, merchandise, and even other digital products like webinars</p>



<p><strong>More creative control over the checkout process</strong></p>



<p>When you integrate WooCommerce with LearnDash, you gain more control over what your customer’s checkout experience will look and feel like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can choose to have a traditional checkout process where your courses and product are laid out in a grid-based format. This is best for selling multiple courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re more interested in increasing course sales, you can use a LearnDash add-on like <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/samcart/">SamCart </a>to get a sales funnel flow. By going this route, you’re able to streamline sales through a one-page checkout experience and include upsells and order bumps to help increase sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By adding WooCommerce, you can customize your product pages to make them more user and sales friendly. You can design your checkout pages to feel more like a sales page with testimonials and product guarantees or give your learners more control to edit their shopping carts with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Subscription and membership capabilities</strong></p>



<p>LearnDash comes with <a href="https://www.learndash.com/features/">subscription and membership </a>capabilities and they work to allow you to customize recurring payment schedules that include course bundles and multi-course access based memberships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WooCommerce expands on those capabilities with added features such as <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/?quid=0769b7cb5f6a9989f0202b3d44fa81a8">auto-renew subscriptions</a>, upgrades/downgrades, and free trial offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Customizable tax and coupon options</strong></p>



<p>Although WooCommerces isn’t a substitute for a tax professional, it has a tax automation feature that will lighten your accounting load.&nbsp; When you set up your WooCommerce account you can choose to have your taxes automatically calculated upon checkout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Custom coupons are also available. WooCommerce allows you to do things like create custom coupon codes to encourage new sign up and referral codes to reward your current learners for inviting new members.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-5-woocommerce-add-ons-and-extensions-to-use-with-learndash"><strong>Top 5 WooCommerce Add-ons and Extensions To Use With LearnDash&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>For additional features and functionality, WooCommerce has hundreds of extensions and over 1,000 plugins to fit whatever you need. Take your course site to the next level with our top 5 WooCommerce add-on and extension recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WooCommerce Payments</strong></p>



<p>To streamline your checkout process, you can use the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-payments/?quid=51620e77de0976cf7ec59037628c2a9f">Woocommerce Payments add-on</a>.&nbsp; Accept all major credit/ debit cards methods locally on your site with this fully integrated payments solution that allows you to keep your payments in one place. There’s no setup fees or monthly transaction fees and you only pay-as-you go per transaction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-18-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-29690"/></figure>



<p>This add-on improves cart abandonment rates by eliminating the need for payment on a third-party website.</p>



<p><strong>Follow-Ups</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/follow-up-emails/?quid=c5cf3da1a6af2bc987ffa62e17e80ed3">Follow-Ups</a> add-on keeps learners engaged with less work and manual effort by allowing you to automate personalized, drip email campaigns. It can be used to check in with learners who are falling behind or missing course content and offer new courses to those who are interested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One notable feature is the integrated Twitter follow-up that automatically tweets learners when they buy or finish a course.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WooCommerce Instagram&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Do you promote your courses on Instagram?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-instagram/?quid=a453dbb0afa7c539d10f1b5553e0c7d8">WooCommerce Instagram</a> extension can boost course sales by allowing prospective learners to be redirected to your course page in one single click. It also helps you increase your visibility by defining product hashtags and allowing your audience to tag their images with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Affiliate for WooCommerce</strong></p>



<p>Courses are all about community. You can offer your community of loyal learners by making them course affiliates through your own affiliate program.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/affiliate-for-woocommerce/?quid=cec8fe4452e1856b55a067400905c268">Affiliate for WooCommerce</a> allows you to track referrals, sales, and commissions in addition to managing payouts.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-have-you-built-your-sales-page-yet">Have You Built Your Sales Page Yet?</h2>



<p>If you are focused on selling your online course one of the final things you have to do before launch is creating your sales page. Late last year I discovered a sales page that I liked and never had the time to circle back and break it down.</p>



<p>So today I&#8217;m going to show you&nbsp;<a href="https://minimumviablevideo.carrd.co/">Minimum Viable Video</a>&nbsp;and their sales page.</p>



<p>Now, before I get started, I should let you know, there are twenty parts to this page. That&#8217;s a lot of parts. You can likely get away with a bit less, but it was done so well, I felt like you need to see the whole thing executed so brilliantly.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s jump in…</p>



<h2>Part One: Let&#8217;s Start with the Hero</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/1.salespage-hero-1024x503-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59512"/></figure>



<p>There are two things I really like about this hero area.</p>



<p><strong>The first is that line above the headline, because it tells us who it is for</strong>. The worst thing you can do is let readers spend minutes going over your offering before figuring out it&#8217;s not for them.</p>



<p><strong>The second is that they&#8217;re connecting what&#8217;s being taught with how you can put it to work</strong>. In other words, even from the very start, Cam is telling us why we should take this course.</p>



<h2>Part Two: The Introduction</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/2.salespage-intro-1024x587-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59513"/></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re selling your online course with a sales page, one of the hardest parts you&#8217;ll likely have is the “talking about yourself” part. But this intro is done really well because it&#8217;s not the “about me” kind of section. Instead, this intro connects you to a real person, highlights that they know what they&#8217;re doing, and connects you (again) to the benefits / results that this course offers.</p>



<h2>Part Three: Don&#8217;t Be Afraid of Words</h2>



<p>One of my buddies,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JustinWise">Justin</a>, once shared an insight from all this work with Facebook Ads. He said that long ads were better (financially) than short ones. Not that short ones didn&#8217;t send more traffic. But that longer ones qualified the traffic better because the people who read the longer ones converted better (when it came time to make a purchase).</p>



<p>In this example, look at all the words that Cam is using to agitate the challenge. He&#8217;s not pushing deep into pain. But he&#8217;s stirring it up.</p>



<p>And he&#8217;s not afraid to use words, lots of them, to do it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/3.salespage-agitate-438x1024-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59514"/></figure>



<h2>Part Four: Benefits as Imagine Statements</h2>



<p>What I love about this next section is that they are all benefits but done as imagine statements. What could you do and accomplish, if you were comfortable doing XX? Let me list all the ways.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/4.salespage-imagine-858x1024-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59515"/></figure>



<h2>Part Five: Dealing with the Challenges</h2>



<p>Now, in this next section, Cam isn&#8217;t dealing with the buying challenges. He&#8217;s not working past your initial conflict over whether to sign up. Instead, he&#8217;s directly attacking the challenges you have with the problem his course is solving.</p>



<p>In other words, he&#8217;s demonstrating his expertise by dealing with your stress in a relatable way that makes you want to sign up and get more of this from him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/5.Salespage-challenges-798x1024-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59516"/></figure>



<h2>Part Six: What&#8217;s Included in the Course</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re selling your online course you&#8217;re eventually going to get to the point where you have to tell people what they&#8217;re going to get. I really like how Cam sets this up. Again, there&#8217;s a lot of insight into how he&#8217;s shaping his content – focusing on benefits even as he&#8217;s telling you what you&#8217;ll get.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/6.salespage-included-1024x965-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59517"/></figure>



<h2>Part Seven: Testimonials</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve told you&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/video-testimonials/">how important testimonials</a>&nbsp;are. Well, you&#8217;ll see them here doing a superb job of convincing you to sign up for the course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/7.salespage-testimonials-1024x271-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59518"/></figure>



<h2>Part Eight: The Instructor</h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;re halfway into this page, it&#8217;s time to introduce you to the author and instructor of the course. But not just his name, but rather his history and qualifications to teach you what he&#8217;s going to teach.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/8.salespage-instructor-1024x695-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59519"/></figure>



<h2>Part Nine: The Course</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/9.salespage-course-1024x711-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59520"/></figure>



<p>Notice that this is the first time you get the course name. And even then, you&#8217;re getting a description of the course without getting the low-level details of the course. Normally we jump too quickly into the details before we&#8217;ve really made sure our reader / prospect is interested. And when they&#8217;re not, they skim past it.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve heard the “leave them wanting more,” well that&#8217;s how this is done.</p>



<h2>Part Ten: More Testimonials</h2>



<p>I don&#8217;t think you need another screenshot of this section. There will be more sections of testimonials. But I do like that the earlier section was text and three columns, and this one is text and two columns.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re likely thinking I would improve this to get video testimonials, but just you wait, he&#8217;ll get there.</p>



<h2>Part Eleven: Course Details</h2>



<p>Now we get to the actual course details. Notice that it starts with what the course isn&#8217;t and then moves into what it is. The focus is on effort, yours as a student, and not just a list of videos.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/11.salespage-coursedetails-782x1024-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59522"/></figure>



<h2>Part Twelve: Video Testimonial</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/12.salespage-videotestimonial-1024x633-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59523"/></figure>



<p>Now we see the introduction (but not the final use) of video testimonials. I think they&#8217;re the best way to close the deal – because they&#8217;re high fidelity.</p>



<p>What you&#8217;ll notice if you watch the videos is that they&#8217;ve been tweaked to add call outs so that the viewer knows what to pay attention to.</p>



<h2>Part Thirteen: What You&#8217;ll Learn</h2>



<p>My favorite line on this whole page is the data-driven articulation of what you&#8217;ll learn in this course. Here is it, “<strong>Students in our previous cohort published over 100 videos combined and improved their skills by 68%.</strong>“</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a powerful way to articulate what you&#8217;ll learn in this course. Because it&#8217;s a data point, it&#8217;s factual, and it&#8217;s a result (not just part of the process).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/13.salespage-whatyoulllearn-911x1024-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59524"/></figure>



<h2>Part Fourteen: Corporate Testimonials</h2>



<p>What I like about section fourteen is that it&#8217;s not just more testimonials. These are different. They&#8217;re corporate testimonials. And that&#8217;s powerful because you get to use those logos from companies you know and trust. It&#8217;s more powerful than just saying that you&#8217;ve helped individuals, small businesses and corporations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/14.salespage-corptestimonials-894x1024-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59525"/></figure>



<h2>Part Fifteen: The Schedule</h2>



<p>It took us getting to part fifteen to see the actual contents of the course. I told you in part nine that they were leaving us wanting more. Well now we&#8217;re here and we get to see the details of the course via their schedule.</p>



<p>Everyone selling their course online will do well to see how slowly they got here.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/15.salespage-schedule-785x1024-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59526"/></figure>



<h2>Part Sixteen: The Results</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/16.salespage-results-1024x906-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59527"/></figure>



<p>By now you realize that this course is a practical one with assignments. It&#8217;s a&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/theres-a-shift-in-elearning/">cohort-based learning course</a>&nbsp;that when completed will leave you with several artifacts that you can use after graduation. So showing you what you leave with is a powerful way to get you to sign up.</p>



<h2>Part Seventeen: Guarantee</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/17.salespage-guarantee-1024x401-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59529"/></figure>



<p>This is the kind of “money back guarantee” that I recommend to anyone I&#8217;m talking to about selling a course. It&#8217;s the “you have to show me you attended and put in the work, and if you&#8217;re still unsatisfied…” kind of approach.</p>



<p>I absolutely love it!</p>



<h2>Part Eighteen: More Video Testimonials</h2>



<p>Yes, even more testimonials. But you knew that was coming right?</p>



<h2>Part Nineteen: How To Know You&#8217;re Ready</h2>



<p>A section I don&#8217;t see enough on sales pages is this “how to know if you&#8217;re ready” kind of page. It&#8217;s an easy way to let prospects qualify and disqualify themselves without a lot of effort.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/19.salespage-ready-971x1024-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59530"/></figure>



<h2>Part Twenty: FAQs</h2>



<p>The final section before another “enroll” now section, which is available in several places on the page, is the FAQ section. The biggest benefit to how these FAQs are designed is that they&#8217;re shaped to mitigate the most common reasons people stop themselves from buying the course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/20.salespage-faq-1024x1005-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-59531"/></figure>



<h2>Selling Your Online Course? Always Look For Examples</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re getting ready to sell your online course, my recommendation is always the same – look for examples you like. Take screenshots, save them, and bookmark pages – all so you can come back and dig into them. Take what you like and use it as a model. Skip what doesn&#8217;t work for you.</p>



<p>But learn from everyone because doing this alone and from scratch is hard.</p>

<h2>How can you compare the cost of your Learning Management System if each service uses a different pricing model? Here’s the breakdown.</h2>



<p>Educators new to online education often find themselves faced with a bewildering array of options for their learning management system. Each of these platforms, apart from offering different features, interfaces, and user experiences, also comes with its own pricing structure—whether that means taking a cut of your sales, charging by the user, offering a tiered monthly subscription, or charging an annual licensing fee.</p>



<p>The LMS pricing plan you choose can have significant repercussions for your business. In some cases, it could expose you to a wide audience while also taking a big chunk of your sales. In others, it could simply make it harder for you to get your business off the ground. However, understanding the implications of these pricing structures can be complex, and since they’re all different, making a one-to-one comparison isn’t always possible.</p>



<p>So, in this post, we’re going to do a deep dive into what some of these pricing structures mean from a business perspective so that you can make the best choice for your learning program.</p>



<h3>Elearning Marketplace: Host your course for free, lose a cut of your profits.</h3>



<p>One of the most famous learning platforms is <a href="https://www.learndash.com/the-risk-with-udemy-and-similar-sites/">Udemy</a>, a global marketplace where any instructor can sign up for free to sell their courses potential learners around the world. Because it’s so well known, it can attract a wide range of learners who can search for courses by subject or keyword. This means instructors on Udemy get to tap into a huge audience without having to build their own marketing from the ground up. Sounds amazing!</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that’s where the good news stops. Udemy strictly controls how sales happen on their site, while also taking a huge cut of all transactions. They not only set both minimum and maximum price points for your courses (nothing under $9.99 and nothing over $199.99), they also take&nbsp;<a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229605008-Instructor-Revenue-Share">63% of all sales</a>&nbsp;made through their marketplace, whether a student has clicked on one of their ads or browsed through the site.</p>



<p>For users who opt into the Udemy Deals Program, the situation can be even worse. Udemy promotes this program as a way for them to run targeted discounts in specific markets to draw in more students, but what this really means is that at any time they can slash the price of your $79.99 course to $9.99 in order to draw in promotional sales, and they walk away with a cut of that revenue.</p>



<p>The only way you can keep most of your list price (97% after transaction fees) is if you run marketing promotions using your own trackable coupons or referral links, but then you’re back to running your marketing yourself.</p>



<h3>Tiered Pricing: Easy onboarding, but everything you need is just out of reach.</h3>



<p>While Udemy is certainly a well-known brand, most LMSs don’t actually use the marketplace pricing structure. Instead, they offer purchasing tiers with monthly or annual subscriptions, so that educators can choose whichever plan seems to best fit their budget and their teaching needs. These LMSs usually offer unlimited users and courses, and only take a modest cut of profits (maybe 5%), and mostly only on their free plans.</p>



<p>Overall, tiered pricing plans like this have a lot of benefits. Users who are just starting out can keep their costs low by going without a few features, while those with bigger budgets can use more advanced tools. However, in practice, this payment structure has some significant pitfalls.</p>



<p>First, as anyone who has ever looked at these pricing tiers knows, the tool you really need always seems to be&nbsp;<em>just</em>out of reach. That’s understandable! LMSs are businesses, and they need to do what they need to do to survive. But when you’re trying to plan a course and even basic features aren’t offered until the “Pro” pricing tier, it can become pretty frustrating.</p>



<p>This is especially true when the tools included at various pricing tiers don’t reflect the actual costs associated with developing them. Sometimes, these LMSs will draw users in by offering expensive services at their lowest pricing tiers (“unlimited <a href="https://www.learndash.com/online-education-is-about-more-than-video/">video hosting</a>!”), but then ask you to pay $99/mo to include graded <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-ways-make-better-quizzes-course/">multiple choice quizzes</a> on your course. Maybe that makes sense to them from a business perspective, but as a user, it just doesn’t feel good.</p>



<p>The bigger problem here is that not every course can be modified easily if it isn’t built with the right tools to begin with. If you build a course using one set of tools, and then later upgrade, making use of your new features means going back and modifying your original course.</p>



<p>What this means is that, if you’re looking at an LMS that uses a tiered pricing structure, do your due diligence to be sure they actually have the tools you need to run a course the way you want to. (In fact, do this research the other way around: first decide what <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-determine-your-lms-needs-when-searching-for-an-elearning-platform/">instructional design tools are important to you</a>,&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;make sure the platform you’re looking at supports them.) Once you’re sure it meets your requirements, look at how they’ve structured their pricing tiers, and decide whether the tier you need is worth the cost.</p>



<h3>Pay Per User: Simpler pricing structure, but a giant bill to match.</h3>



<p>Some LMSs takes a different approach. Rather than basing their pricing tiers on features, they charges based on the number of users on your account (or the number of courses you create).</p>



<p>Let’s take Talent LMS as an example. Talent is an impressive platform, with a lot of the advanced elearning features that are sadly lacking from competitors like <a href="https://www.learndash.com/lms-comparison-learndash-vs-teachable/">Teachable</a>, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/lms-comparison-learndash-vs-thinkific/">Thinkific</a>, or <a href="https://www.learndash.com/lms-comparison-learndash-vs-kajabi/">Kajabi</a>. Their basic plan, which starts at $59/mo., will cap your users at 40. The next plan up, which costs $129/mo., caps users at 100, and so on and so forth. These are for their standard plans, when you already know how many learners you expect to have. If you want a little more flexibility, you can opt for their “active plan,” which won’t cap your users, but will charge a higher rate for any users beyond your plan’s limit.</p>



<p>In many ways, they’re wise to choose a pricing structure that puts their full range of features in the hands of their users as quickly as possible. It means their users can start building the course they had actually envisioned from day one, instead of being hampered in the early stages of their course from a lack of necessary tools. Plus, users face no tough calls about whether to double their monthly bill just to get the one key feature left out of the lower pricing tier.</p>



<p>However, tying the monthly bill to the number of active users poses some sales problems. You might easily be misled into reading $129/month for up to 100 users as “each user costs $1.29.” That’s not going to make or break the cost of your course, and you can easily bump the price of your course up to cover it.</p>



<p>But that $1.29/user fee isn’t just one payment. It’s every month. Over the course of a year, that user will cost you $15.48, and will continue to do so for as long as they’re on your account, regardless of whether they’re still paying for content.</p>



<p>Now, maybe if you’re selling your course for $2,000, and it doesn’t matter much to you whether a user stays on your account for four or five years after making that one purchase. This pricing model may also work fine for large corporations, who don’t mind paying less than $20 a year per employee on their platform. But for anyone running a business with tighter profit margins, these expenses can be crippling.</p>



<h3>Self-hosted + Licensing: A little more set-up, a lot more control.</h3>



<p>As a WordPress-based LMS, we here at LearnDash operate under a different model altogether. Instead of hosting your course ourselves, we leave it to you to choose the hosting option that best fits your needs. This is one of the biggest costs for most users, but it’s also the one that will have the most significant implications for their course infrastructure.</p>



<p>Once they have their WordPress website set up (or if they happen to already be running a WordPress website), they can then purchase our premium plugin for an annual licensing fee of $189 (our Plus Package, including Pro Panel). With that they have access to&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;our plugin offers, along with as many users and courses as their hosting plan can support. And we don’t charge a cut of your course sales either—you keep every penny you earn.</p>



<p>For some educators, particularly those who are worried about their technical abilities, the thought of setting up a website can be intimidating—especially as the hassle is often exaggerated. The reality is that you don’t need to be a web developer to launch a course using LearnDash, and we’ve heard from many users who describe themselves as not being technically savvy that they were able to successfully launch a course on our platform.</p>



<p>And the benefits to building your online course on WordPress are significant. You get to use the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-reasons-wordpress-is-the-best-choice-for-course-creators/">world’s foremost Content Management System</a> (CMS), you retain full ownership of all your content and data, and you aren’t held back by new restrictions that always seem to pop up the moment your course seems on the verge of taking off.</p>



<h3>Choose the LMS pricing plan that supports your business’s growth.</h3>



<p>Launching a business is tough. There’s a lot of hard work that goes into the planning and execution, and a lot of big decisions get made even before you bring in your first sale. That’s why your choice of platform—and the pricing model it uses—is so important to your long-term success.</p>



<p>If you’re losing a portion of your profits every time you land a sale, or if the tools you need are always out of reach, or if you’re paying extra for each new user or each new course, getting the momentum you need to grow a thriving business will only be that much harder.</p>



<p>So go easy on yourself and choose the option that won’t hold you back. Choose us.</p>
