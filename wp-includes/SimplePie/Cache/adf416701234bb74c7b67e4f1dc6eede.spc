<p>Years ago, elearning was a novelty in the world of higher education. But these days, more colleges and universities than ever are offering online courses and virtual degree-granting programs.</p>



<p>Wondering if it’s time to embrace elearning in your own higher-ed setting? Here are several reasons it’s essential, both for students and for educators.</p>



<h2 id="h-elearning-benefits-for-learners">Elearning Benefits for Learners</h2>



<p>Today’s students favor online learning for numerous reasons. These are a few of the most vital:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility. </strong>Just as remote workers have embraced the flexibility of virtual workplaces, many students expect the same level of flexibility from their education. A majority of students opt for remote education specifically to avoid going to campus, according to <a href="https://universityservices.wiley.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/202209-VOL2022-report-WUNI_Final_Update.pdf">a national survey from Wiley Educational Services</a>; nearly 70 percent of respondents said they prefer asynchronous programs. This format gives students the option to study at their own pace and complete courses on their own schedule.</li>



<li><strong>Personalization</strong>. For some students, elearning can provide a personalized approach to education that might not be possible to achieve in a traditional classroom. By customizing their courses and curating their own curriculum, learners can focus on areas where they need the most support.</li>



<li><strong>Access</strong>. By offering your students the ability to study from anywhere with an internet connection, you can provide greater access to education. This can be especially impactful in remote locations or areas without nearby access to college-level courses.</li>



<li><strong>Multimedia</strong>. Elearning also provides a unique opportunity to engage learners with multimedia content such as videos, animations, and simulations. This content not only keeps virtual learners engaged but can also enhance retention of course material.</li>



<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>. With online learning, students can take advantage of opportunities to collaborate and interact with their peers and instructors through online forums and discussion boards. This can help foster a sense of community and support among learners as they build relationships through the screen.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-elearning-benefits-for-educators">Elearning Benefits for Educators</h2>



<p>Both educators and students stand to benefit from <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-online-learning-is-vital-to-education/">online learning in higher education</a>. Here are some of the pros of elearning from an educator’s perspective:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Increased engagement. </strong>While it’s true that distance learning comes with <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED610374.pdf">some challenges</a>, elearning can also provide <em>more</em> opportunities for instructors to create engaging, interactive learning experiences. With interactive quizzes and assessments, gamification, and other multimedia, educators can take advantage of online learning to increase student engagement.</li>



<li><strong>Flexibility. </strong>It isn’t just a benefit for students: Educators can also enjoy more flexibility in how they deliver lessons. Creating and sharing course material online allows you to easily customize lessons to suit individual students’ needs and preferences.</li>



<li><strong>Data analytics. </strong>For many educators, elearning has enhanced the ability to track student progress and performance. With a powerful learning management system, you can monitor students throughout your courses and identify areas where students need more support or resources. The learnings you glean can also help you improve your courses from session to session.</li>



<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>. Forget last-minute trips to the copy room. By embracing elearning, educators can create and share course materials online and reduce the need for textbooks and paper handouts. Streamlining your teaching process lets you focus on high-quality instruction and keeping students engaged.</li>



<li><strong>Professional development. </strong>Instructors aren’t just teaching their own courses online—they’re also brushing up on their own skills and seeking professional development opportunities for themselves. As an instructor, you can enroll in virtual courses to help you expand your skills and follow the latest trends and best practices in your field.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-take-the-step-to-online-learning-in-your-own-classroom">Take the step to online learning in your own classroom</h2>



<p>Today’s students expect flexible online learning options, and educators can also benefit from the power and efficiency of elearning.&nbsp;</p>

The platform has over <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats">2.6 billion users worldwide</a>, and you can tap into this never-ending source of traffic to increase subscribers to your channel.</h1>



<p>As a course creator, more subscribers means more leads and a boost in the passive income generated through your elearning platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in order to be successful, you must have an effective strategy. With that in mind, here are the seven steps to start a YouTube channel to complement your online courses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-1-use-free-content-to-introduce-new-leads-to-your-brand">1. Use Free Content to Introduce New Leads to Your Brand</h2>



<p>Creating valuable free content is one of the best ways to stand out when promoting your online course on YouTube. You can offer videos and tutorials as a way to introduce new leads to your brand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you prove your value by uploading new content regularly, it simplifies the process of transforming your audience from free YouTube viewers to paying students.&nbsp; Viewers will be so impressed with your free material that they’ll start to wonder about the value they might get with your premium course.</p>



<p>A great way to use this marketing tactic is to <strong>publish free mini-courses</strong> on your channel. This helps familiarize students with your teaching style and build better relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, it’s a great way to sell naturally. At the end of your free course, you can invite learners to check out your premium course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to creating free content for your channel, you can also <strong>give away a premium lesson </strong>for free. This is probably the best way to prove to your audience that they will find real value in your course. Just make sure this is a lesson that can work well as a standalone video.</p>



<p>Publish the lesson on your channel and add the link to your homepage. If you have a newsletter, add the link there so subscribers can check out your course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-2-create-a-channel-trailer-to-attract-interest">2. Create a Channel Trailer to Attract Interest</h2>



<p>It’s smart to include some marketing in your video content, and a great way to do this is by creating a <a href="https://www.veedyou.com/9-tips-for-epic-youtube-channel-trailers/">YouTube channel trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trailer videos are great for grabbing your audience’s interest. You can use them to help prospective students imagine different ways they could change their life or business with your course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By showing them what’s possible, you make it a lot more likely that they will want to sign up for your course.</p>



<p>You can use a tool like Animaker’s all-in-one trailer maker to produce a gripping trailer for your channel.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UA6vqZBKXOtRVwFC7Fx_4T5iuDbsV28FvSZA3AwIlQYUFfjFpGRlbtOP3ydi4oMGWiBwh1fNn0EOAwJJu6VCRfqvq6CI-ZTRJoNa932G2upO0x8W2kd1ptnt60EyGuqdd2TW7ErQF09l5q-DMUsvDTU" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.animaker.com/trailer-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></p>



<p>Create a trailer video that points your audience toward your online course <em>or </em>lead magnet. Post this as your channel’s trailer. Since it has a prominent place on your home page, it will help you get more people to check out your course or lead magnet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your online course isn’t the only focus of your channel, then you can include it as an aside after your main video footage. </p>



<p>Either way, make sure you include a strong call to action (CTA) at the end of your video trailer. This is essential to get your viewers to take some kind of action, such as:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Purchasing your online course</li>



<li><a href="https://wpastra.com/blogging/how-to-build-an-email-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joining your email list</a></li>



<li>Becoming part of your online community</li>



<li>Subscribing to your YouTube channel</li>



<li>Connecting with you on other platforms</li>
</ul>



<p>…and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just remember to use one CTA at a time to avoid confusing your viewers. Though different, each CTA works effectively, and you must choose the one that’s relevant to your goals.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-3-incentivize-viewers-to-purchase-your-course">3. Incentivize Viewers to Purchase Your Course</h2>



<p>As the second-largest search engine in the world, YouTube is already attracting millions of viewers who are looking for the type of information you provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s up to you to give them a good enough reason why <em>your </em>online course may be the ideal solution to their problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can do this in a number of ways. Here are a few examples:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Create teasers:</strong> Create short videos with sneak peeks and helpful tips to incentivize viewers to purchase your online course or subscribe to a series. This type of content helps increase the buzz around your course and can generate more leads and sales.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Livestream R=regularly: </strong>Expert marketers will tell you that the best way to sell to anyone is through a live one-on-one conversation. The second-best way is a video call. It’s obvious why this is so true; talking to someone directly is a lot more powerful than posting on social media or sending an email through your <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-email-marketing-software-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email marketing platform</a>. </li>
</ul>



<p>Talk to your audience about their problems and answer their questions. Position your course as the ideal solution to help them achieve their goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Build a community:</strong> YouTube has a feature that makes it easy for creators to build a community around their topic. You can use non-video content here, such as stories and shorts, to engage your audience and reach even more people who are interested in your course. </li>
</ul>



<p>Don’t forget to add a compelling call to action to your videos. And make it easy for your viewers to take the next step toward purchasing your course or subscribing to a series, which gives you even more opportunities to convert viewers into customers (more on that below).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-4-get-subscribers-to-your-youtube-channel">4. Get Subscribers to Your YouTube Channel</h2>



<p>It’s tempting to want to include a link that goes directly to your online course sales page. But when dealing with your YouTube audience, it’s a lot easier to start small and offer them a lead magnet instead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although your end goal is to sell your course, make it your <em>immediate </em>goal to collect your viewers’ email addresses from your YouTube channel. This will allow you to stay connected to them so you can navigate them toward the ultimate goal of purchasing your online course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many businesses rely on email as a cost-effective way to acquire new customers and leads. With an average return on investment of <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$36 for each dollar spent</a> it’s not hard to see why. </p>



<p>To <a href="https://www.sender.net/blog/email-collection-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start collecting emails</a>, include a link to your lead magnet wherever you can. For instance, you can add a link to </p>



<ul>
<li>Your video description</li>



<li>End screen</li>



<li>Annotations&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cards, etc.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you have your lead magnet and updated links pointing to your opt-in page, you’ll be able to start collecting your viewers’ email addresses. After you complete the process, it’s worth using an <a href="https://www.voilanorbert.com/verify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email verification tool</a> to verify email addresses and keep your email list clean.</p>



<p>From there, you can start building and nurturing your relationship with customers via email and warm them up to purchasing your course.</p>



<p>Check out this example of how entrepreneur Elna Cain includes a link to her lead magnet (Free Business Plan) on her channel’s main header links.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Zdp8bueNnsEg02pSrq4zlIDdZyxzfq14hB28vRF47sjC9yyw1_0YZSBp_000bX_b1JJjzSTdvxraEJAHybpx3tl1LW9UkV7um3VYff7LsYdXZiMVq9FyU1AhX01NqoVYjGjhZk3vvL-wkuFCm5bxyOI" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElnaWrites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></p>



<p>She also includes it in her description below the published video. In fact, she makes sure to include links to her lead magnet wherever possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-5-cross-share-content-across-multiple-media-channels">5. Cross-Share Content Across Multiple Media Channels</h2>



<p>The videos you create for your YouTube channel can be cross-shared across social media channels and email newsletters to promote your new online course. You can also embed them into course landing pages or even start a blog that will complement your efforts. Plus, don’t neglect to repurpose YouTube videos as YouTube Shorts or native social media videos and turn them into new podcast episodes, blogs, and social media posts, and so on.</p>



<p>Just remember, although the goal is to make sales, it’s not a good idea to sell on every video. This won’t help you build a good relationship with your subscribers and fans across different platforms. Focus on creating content that educates and entertains. Tutorials, reviews, and customer stories are great options too. This builds a better connection with your followers and establishes trust.</p>



<p>You need to first show them that you have value to offer; then, they will trust you when you offer your premium course to help them solve their problems or achieve their goals. </p>



<p>So, when cross-sharing your content, make sure it’s a healthy mix of educational, personal, and promotional content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few tips on how you might incorporate utilized these content pillars into your marketing strategy: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Educational Content: </strong>Share helpful videos that educate your viewers for free. Don’t forget to include a call to action to like, subscribe, share, comment, or check out more videos on your channel. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Stories: </strong>You can share personal stories to help build deeper relationships with your audience. Showing your authentic self helps makes it easier to build credibility and trust. Include a CTA at the end of your video for viewers to join your email list or online community. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Promotional Videos:</strong> These are videos that you create specifically to promote your online courses, such as teasers and trailers. At the end of each, make sure to include a strong CTA to check out your premium course. </li>
</ul>



<p>You can increase your promotional activities on special days. For example, you can use coupons and <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-course-creators-can-take-advantage-of-black-friday-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discount offers on special occasions</a>, like Black Friday, Thanksgiving, etc. This will help you get even more eyeballs to your content. </p>



<h2 id="h-6-include-testimonial-videos-as-social-proof">6. Include Testimonial Videos as Social Proof</h2>

<p>Our featured customer this month is <a href="https://thedancedojo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dance Dojo</a>: Online Salsa and Bachata courses that help teach beginners how to dance like a pro. </p>



<p>The Dance Dojo is the most popular salsa dance course on the internet. Instead of focusing on teaching complex patterns like most instructors, they’ve broken down the learning process into tiny steps that focus on learning individual moves, foundations, and technique.</p>



<p>The courses are easy to digest, go step by step, and help anyone develop strong foundations to build on. Their courses are for anyone who wants to learn to salsa dance and go out &#8220;social dancing&#8221; at parties, to meet new people, and develop a sense of community.</p>



<p>Since its launch, the Dance Dojo has seen over 3,800 students from 68 countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s explore how The Dance Dojo uses LearnDash to power its successful online dance courses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-two-immersive-courses">Two Immersive Courses</h2>



<p>On the home page, you’ll see the option to get started right away learning either salsa or Bachata from skilled professionals. The landing page copy addresses common concerns many have found with free content on YouTube. They aim to solve those pain points with a dedicated course structure that includes theory as well as instruction. The call to action to “get started for free” compels users to try out the courses.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Arvr2AfPEDTebNOlTXFCt4ZUcOgdeCab0YfO-FKF9r4MnKexTJ91u6c67xPcF1XjOoI-rcuGT30ygERTyG4Sx_YsjjP9YrjRyjHJmUvabD9Y9Cu5WbQrAT2akiTfo9fwpBp2GjcDpheTTyiE2lHT2C8" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When you click “Get Started for free,” a new page explains how to access a free week of classes. This is made possible using LearnDash’s <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/courses/course-access/">Course Access</a> settings. This is built right into the course editor and allows you to control when and how folks access your courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To set a free trial, navigate to Settings and scroll down to “Course Access Expiration.” Toggle on the button and set the length of your free trial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all! LearnDash will now grant access to the course for the specified number of days, starting on the user’s enrollment date. LearnDash also gives you a Data Deletion option, so you can choose to either store or erase a registrant’s course data after their access has expired.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8yWbMBYij_7sOXk8vRzU6ZuD34TPzlpqUoLH6YhdHRhgINN5APqq4Olqf4gfB1bCpP0xHzUTP2e3Zr_Cer239Bld1PSg5aOqtBYCGH8B_lqExctDL7XXep1rDRI-epoe_5m0UAtYuMJXNHgscdQnxmY" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-robust-lessons">Robust Lessons</h2>



<p>Once in a course, you’ll see just how thorough these lessons are. They break down not only how to perform the movements but also the challenges dancers may face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While in a lesson, you’ll see your course navigation on the left, with the lesson content on the right, so you never lose your place. You’ll see that Dance Dojo makes well-organized use of LearnDash’s Lessons and Topics features to break down the concepts in an easy-to-follow manner. Vimeo videos are embedded right into lessons – in fact, you can create an entire course in minutes by simply uploading a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXCctTk320s">Vimeo playlist.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>LearnDash also allows you to add multiple topics to a single page, so your learners can jump in between videos to remember previous steps without loading new pages. Once finished, learners can mark the lesson as complete to track their progress. The Module Progress bar at the top also helps learners stay focused on completing the lesson and adds a small bit of gamification to see that the progress bar is filled in 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oAfelK-mMQ0zU_YywHe7w7IvS5fLSDC7XmJ8HmJPCy6wVtnyGk5RQHC4Wl3liAT17lhom9-4ywV6lv0tXWxK9Af_PGNQud7WrjeQki5XfB2L8_ne7sG5-WHkMdRiw15q7SLDBL2LnoKwHbDyQ2QwXUA" alt=""/></figure>

<p>“Using LearnDash allowed us to stick with WordPress and have the flexibility to design the UX how we wanted it. In Kajabi for example, you can&#8217;t place more than one video in a lesson. It just didn&#8217;t quite fit our existing structure. LearnDash is a good-looking LMS that you can plugin to WordPress that&#8217;s flexible enough for any knowledge/info/course business.”</p>

<p>The role of an instructional designer is critical in creating successful learning experiences. Instructional designers are responsible for designing courses that meet learners’ needs and achieve objectives.</p>



<p>Instructional designers do this in a few ways. First, they&#8217;ll analyze learners&#8217; preferences and characteristics to ensure that the learning experience is tailored to their needs. Based on this analysis, they’ll design and structure the learning experience. They’ll test, gather feedback, and make revisions. They&#8217;ll use this evaluation to find opportunities for improvement.</p>



<p>Using an instructional designer can take the manual labor out of course building and make your courses an engaging experience. When finding the perfect instructional designer for your project, there are specific qualifications that you should look for. Here are some criteria to remember when hiring an instructional designer for your next course.</p>



<h2 id="h-qualifications-to-look-for-in-an-instructional-designer">Qualifications to Look for in an Instructional Designer</h2>



<p>An instructional designer needs a combination of education, experience, and skills to be effective. Here are some of the qualities to keep an eye out for.</p>



<h3 id="h-experience-with-instructional-design-tools-and-technology">Experience with instructional design tools and technology</h3>



<p>You’ll need someone with experience using instructional design software, authoring tools, and learning management systems. For example, if you’re using LearnDash, your designer should know how to build within the LearnDash LMS. They should also be familiar with current trends in educational technology and be able to integrate new technologies. They should also have experience in project management to ensure the course-building project is executed successfully.</p>



<h3 id="h-strong-understanding-of-learning-theory">Strong understanding of learning theory</h3>



<p>A strong understanding of learning theories, such as behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism, is essential. Understanding how learners learn will ensure courses are designed to promote engagement from the start. Look for evidence that designers have applied these theories to create effective learning experiences.</p>



<h3 id="h-ability-to-evaluate-the-effectiveness-of-instructional-design">Ability to evaluate the effectiveness of instructional design</h3>



<p>Instructional designers should be able to think creatively to design engaging and effective experiences. They should also be able to think critically to test their designs&#8217; effectiveness and make improvements. They should have strong communication skills to communicate about the project with you clearly and effectively.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-instructional-designers">Where to Find Instructional Designers</h2>

<p>When people hear the term “artificial intelligence” they tend to think of rogue robots, anarchic androids or sinister cyborgs taking over the world and giving humanity the same short shrift that the asteroid gave to the dinosaurs all of those years ago. While, we admit, an AI-induced apocalypse might—but probably won’t—one day come to pass, the AI that we have today is here to help.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’ll show you how to use OpenAI and ChatGPT models with LearnDash so you can harness the power of AI for your e-learning platform. Automatically draft lessons, create course outlines, and even answer students’ questions with the help of AI and automation tools such as Uncanny Automator.</p>



<p>Join the robot revolution in e-learning—and save yourself countless hours and thousands of dollars in the process!</p>



<h2 id="h-introduction-to-openai-and-chatgpt"><strong>Introduction to OpenAI and ChatGPT</strong></h2>



<p>OpenAI is the artificial intelligence research laboratory behind the popular chatbot, ChatGPT. Built on OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) model, ChatGPT is the very latest in natural language processing (NLP) technology.</p>



<p>With a beta version that launched in 2020, the AI uses statistical modeling and deep learning to create human-like text. That’s basically just the high-tech way of saying that ChatGPT read a lot (and we mean A LOT) of content across the internet to learn how people write on various topics so that it could do the same.</p>

To create an account, all you need is an email and a password—and the ability to take a single-question Turing test to prove that you are not, yourself, a robot.</p>



<h2 id="h-introduction-to-learndash"><strong>Introduction to LearnDash</strong></h2>



<p>LearnDash is the #1 learning management system (LMS) for WordPress. Whether you’re running an after school program or managing training and compliance for a multinational corporation, LearnDash has all of the features you need to create a functional (and futuristic) digital classroom.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-2.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash LearnDash Homepage" class="wp-image-125284"/></figure></div>


<p>With LearnDash, you can easily build your e-learning platform from the ground up—from granular lessons and quizzes, up to modules and even course groups that define entire curricula. And don’t forget to keep your students motivated with certificates for completion or outstanding grades.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already,&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/share/learndash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>&nbsp;to get the LearnDash plugin and join the future of e-learning!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-benefits-of-automation-and-ai-in-e-learning"><strong>The Benefits of Automation and AI in E-learning</strong></h2>



<p>Pairing your LearnDash LMS with OpenAI comes with several benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Save Time:</strong>&nbsp;OpenAI churns out large amounts of text faster than a caffeinated cartoon typist. Cut back on the time it takes you to create course content, leaving you more time to interact with your students.</li>



<li><strong>Save Money:</strong>&nbsp;Cut back on your content creation costs with OpenAI by reducing the amount of time it takes to generate quality content.</li>



<li><strong>Stay on Brand:</strong>&nbsp;Once you find the right configurations and prompts for your OpenAI model, you’ll be able to rapidly produce content that is consistent and on-brand.</li>
</ul>



<p>Developers and educators are constantly finding new ways to apply AI to e-learning. But here are just some of the ways that you can start using AI in your LearnDash LMS today:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Create Course Outlines:</strong>&nbsp;Standardize your course creation process and help educators save time with auto-generated course outlines.</li>



<li><strong>Draft Lessons:</strong>&nbsp;Use simple forms or other input methods to automate the process of drafting new lessons.</li>



<li><strong>Tutor and Support:</strong>&nbsp;Once you get the hang of OpenAI, you can create chatbots to help tutor your students and support them through the learning process.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the following sections, we’re going to actually walk through the steps of connecting LearnDash to OpenAI. You’ll need at least the Pro version of&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/">Uncanny Automator</a>&nbsp;to follow along, however Automator offers a 14-day money back guarantee so trying out premium features comes at no-risk to you.</p>



<p>After you’ve downloaded Automator Pro,&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/open-ai/">read this guide</a>&nbsp;on connecting it with your new OpenAI account or find the abridged version below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Under your account tab in your OpenAI account page, click on&nbsp;<strong>View API keys</strong>. In the&nbsp;<em>API Keys</em>&nbsp;screen, click&nbsp;<strong>Create new secret key</strong>&nbsp;and copy the new key.</li>



<li>From your WordPress Admin Sidebar, navigate to&nbsp;<em>Automator</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Settings</em>. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Premium integrations</strong>&nbsp;tab and scroll down to&nbsp;<strong>OpenAI</strong>.</li>



<li>Paste the key from your OpenAI account into the field labeled&nbsp;<em>Secret key</em>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Connect OpenAI account</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Now you’re ready to power your LearnDash LMS with OpenAI!</p>



<h2 id="h-build-an-ai-generated-course-outline"><strong>Build an AI-Generated Course Outline</strong></h2>



<p>OpenAI is, perhaps unsurprisingly, great at understanding structure—it is, after all, a computer. That makes it the perfect teacher’s assistant when it comes to creating course outlines. Here’s how it’s done.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-1-create-a-new-recipe"><strong>Step 1: Create a New Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>From your WordPress Admin Sidebar, navigate to&nbsp;<em>Automator</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Add New</em>. In the pop-up window that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Logged-in users</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/How-to-Automate-Your-Customer-Onboarding-Process-25-%E2%80%94-Recipe-type-selector-Logged-in-users.png" alt="Automator Recipe type selector Logged-in users" class="wp-image-120181"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-2-name-your-recipe"><strong>Step 2: Name Your Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>We’ve named this recipe&nbsp;<em>OpenAI LearnDash Course Outline</em>&nbsp;but we recommend coming up with whatever naming convention suits your workflows best.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-3-configure-your-trigger-s"><strong>Step 3: Configure Your Trigger(s)</strong></h3>



<p>The trigger is the event that will set your recipe into motion. For our workflows, we’ve created a WPForms form to pass information to OpenAI. Based on the OpenAI inputs (that we’ll discuss later), a basic form can look something like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-4.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash WPForms" class="wp-image-125285"/></figure></div>


<p>A form-based trigger can be useful to restrict direct access to OpenAI while still allowing multiple users to take advantage of it.</p>



<p>To use a form-based trigger, in the&nbsp;<em>Triggers</em>&nbsp;panel, from the menu of available integrations, click&nbsp;<strong>WPForms</strong>&nbsp;or your preferred form-building plugin.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-5.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator WPForms Integration" class="wp-image-125286"/></figure></div>


<p>From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>A user submits a form</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-6.png" alt="Automator WPForms Action A user submits a form" class="wp-image-125287"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator will prompt you to select a form. After you’ve selected your course outline creator form, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. Your trigger should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-7.png" alt="Automator WPForms Action A user submits a form Live" class="wp-image-125288"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-4-configure-your-primary-action"><strong>Step 4: Configure Your Primary Action</strong></h3>



<p>In the Actions panel, click&nbsp;<strong>Add action</strong>. From the menu of available integrations, select&nbsp;<strong>OpenAI</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-8.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI Integration" class="wp-image-125289"/></figure></div>


<p>From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Use a prompt to generate text with the Davinci model</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-9.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Action Use prompt to generate text with the Davinci Model" class="wp-image-125290"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator will present you with an editor where you can configure the information that it will pass along to OpenAI.</p>



<p><em>Temperature</em>&nbsp;defines how “creative” you want OpenAI to be in its response with lower values indicating less creativity and higher values indicating more creativity.</p>



<p><em>Maximum length</em>&nbsp;refers to the number of tokens that OpenAI has, with 100 OpenAI tokens roughly correlating to 75 English language words. For a comprehensive breakdown of OpenAI tokens,&nbsp;<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.</p>



<p>Not to be confused with OpenAI’s tokens, Automator has its own&nbsp;<em>tokens</em>&nbsp;(i.e., dynamic pieces of data pulled from your website and even from within recipes).</p>



<p>In our example, we’re allowing users to pass along both&nbsp;<em>temperature</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>maximum length</em>&nbsp;information to OpenAI by using Automator tokens that pull data from the WPForms trigger. To use Automator tokens, click on the&nbsp;<strong>Asterisk</strong>&nbsp;and select a token from the drop-down list.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-10.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Tokens" class="wp-image-125291"/></figure></div>


<p>Note: In practice,&nbsp;<em>temperature</em>&nbsp;is correlated to your brand’s voice and OpenAI calculates cost based on the number of tokens you use. As such, you may not want to permit all users to change those settings and opt, instead, to use static values in those fields.</p>



<p>Using all Automator tokens, we’ve filled in the remaining fields as such:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-11.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Action Tokens" class="wp-image-125292"/></figure></div>


<p>Once you’ve filled in the fields in the way that best suits your workflows, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. Your action should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-12.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Action Use prompt to generate text with the Davinci Model Live" class="wp-image-125293"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-5-configure-your-secondary-action"><strong>Step 5: Configure Your Secondary Action</strong></h3>



<p>The first action that we’ve created will get OpenAI to generate our course outline. This secondary action will get that course outline created in LearnDash.</p>



<p>In the&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel, click&nbsp;<strong>Add action</strong>. From the menu of available integrations, select&nbsp;<strong>WordPress</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-13.png" alt="Automator WordPress Integration" class="wp-image-125294"/></figure></div>


<p>From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Create a post</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-14.png" alt="Automator WordPress Action Create a post" class="wp-image-125295"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator will present you with an editor, similar to the one from the first OpenAI action. In the field labeled&nbsp;<em>Type</em>, select&nbsp;<em>Course</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-15.png" alt="Automator WordPress Action Create a post Type Course" class="wp-image-125296"/></figure></div>


<p>In the field labeled&nbsp;<em>Content</em>&nbsp;is where we’re going to include the output from OpenAI. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Asterisk</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Use a prompt to generate text with the Davinci model</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Response</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-16.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Tokens Response" class="wp-image-125297"/></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, in the&nbsp;<em>Title</em>&nbsp;field, use the&nbsp;<em>Course Title</em>&nbsp;token from the WPForms trigger to automatically generate your course title.</p>



<p>Once you’re finished, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. Your&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel should now look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-17.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI and LearnDash Actions" class="wp-image-125298"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-6-it-s-alive-it-s-alive"><strong>Step 6: It’s Alive! It’s Alive!</strong></h3>



<p>The last thing for you to do is to toggle the recipe from&nbsp;<em>Draft</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Live</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-21.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI LearnDash Course Outline Recipe" class="wp-image-125299"/></figure></div>


<p>Just for fun, here’s the course outline that OpenAI returned from the information that we put in our form:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-22.png" alt="OpenAI Sample Writing Introduction to Supercomputers" class="wp-image-125300"/></figure></div>


<p>…maybe the AI is sentient after all.</p>



<p>Note: OpenAI is fast—but not necessarily instantaneous. It can take a few seconds to return content, so if you don’t see a new post right after it runs, wait approximately 30 seconds. The time it will take also depends on the model you choose (Davinci is slowest) and the number of tokens you allow (more tokens means more time). If the action times out, consider changing the model or reducing the number of tokens.</p>



<h2 id="h-build-an-ai-generated-lesson"><strong>Build an AI-Generated Lesson</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we have our outline, it’s time to generate the lessons that will make up the bulk of our course content. And if anyone knows anything about supercomputers, it’s probably OpenAI—<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-builds-a-supercomputer-for-openai-for-training-massive-ai-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s built on one</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-1-create-a-new-recipe-1"><strong>Step 1: Create a New Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>From your WordPress Admin Sidebar, navigate to&nbsp;<em>Automator</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Add New</em>. In the pop-up window that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Logged-in users</em>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-2-name-your-recipe-1"><strong>Step 2: Name Your Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>We’ve named this recipe&nbsp;<em>OpenAI Lesson Generator</em>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-3-configure-your-trigger"><strong>Step 3: Configure Your Trigger</strong></h3>



<p>We’ll be using the same form submission trigger with a different form for this recipe as we did with the last one, albeit with a much higher temperature.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-23.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash WPForms Lesson" class="wp-image-125301"/></figure></div>


<p>In the&nbsp;<em>Triggers</em>&nbsp;panel of the recipe builder, from the menu of available integrations, click&nbsp;<strong>WPForms</strong>&nbsp;or your preferred form-building plugin</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-24.gif" alt="Automator WPForms Trigger A user submits a form" class="wp-image-125302"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-4-configure-your-primary-action-1"><strong>Step 4: Configure Your Primary Action</strong></h3>



<p>We’ll be using the same primary action for this recipe as we did in the previous one with slightly different configurations for OpenAI.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-25.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash OpenAI Prompt Editor" class="wp-image-125303"/></figure></div>


<p>Once you’re finished, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-5-configure-your-secondary-action-1"><strong>Step 5: Configure Your Secondary Action</strong></h3>



<p>This secondary action is also very similar to the secondary action from the first recipe, with the only difference being that we’re creating a lesson instead of a course.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-26.png" alt="Automator WordPress Action Create a post Type Lesson" class="wp-image-125304"/></figure></div>


<p>Your&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel should look something like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-27.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI and LearnDash Actions Lesson" class="wp-image-125305"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-6-go-live"><strong>Step 6: Go Live</strong></h3>



<p>Toggle your recipe from&nbsp;<em>Draft</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Live</em>. It should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-28.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI LearnDash Lesson Draft Recipe" class="wp-image-125306"/></figure></div>


<p>Here’s a snippet of the lesson that OpenAI returned:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-29.png" alt="OpenAI Sample Writing on Introduction to Supercomputers" class="wp-image-125308"/></figure></div>


<h2 id="h-generate-unique-featured-images-for-your-new-content"><strong>Generate Unique Featured Images for Your New Content</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve ever wondered what artificial intelligence does in its spare time, wonder no longer: it creates beautiful works of art.</p>



<p>With OpenAI’s image-generator, DALL-E 2, you can create original images that suit your needs—no matter how outlandish they are. Even if you asked DALL-E 2 to generate totally random images of, say, “a kangaroo dressed as a French artist sitting at an easel in the desert at dusk, digital art”.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-101.png" alt="DALL-E 2 images of a kangaroo painting in a desert" class="wp-image-127258"/></figure></div>


<p>Now that you see what DALL-E 2 can do and you’ve created some new course and lesson content, it’s time to add original featured images using Automator’s OpenAI integration.</p>



<p>We modified our original WPForms form to include an image prompt field.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-102.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash WPForms course and image prompt form" class="wp-image-127260"/></figure></div>


<p>Next, in our&nbsp;<em>OpenAI LearnDash Course Outline</em>&nbsp;recipe, we’ll add the action to generate an image using the prompt from our updated form.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-103.gif" alt="Automator OpenAI integration to generate an image" class="wp-image-127261"/></figure></div>


<p>In our WordPress action to create a post, we simply add the image URL token from our OpenAI action into the&nbsp;<em>Featured image URL</em>&nbsp;field.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-104.png" alt="Automator OpenAI integration image url tokens" class="wp-image-127264"/></figure></div>


<p>Note: Actions in Automator occur sequentially as they appear on screen. If the OpenAI action to generate an image appears after the WordPress action to create a post, then the image url tokens will not appear in the WordPress action. To correct this, simply drag the OpenAI action above the WordPress action and the image url tokens will appear.</p>



<p>With the action to generate an image, your new recipe should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-105.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Course Outline Recipe with Image" class="wp-image-127265"/></figure></div>


<p>Our new course outline now includes some amazing, AI-generated artwork.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Automator also saved us the trouble of downloading the image ourselves and uploaded it directly into our WordPress media library.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 id="h-build-an-ai-powered-chatbot-for-students"><strong>Build an AI-Powered Chatbot for Students</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we have AI-generated course content, why not extend the power of AI to&nbsp; support your students with a chatbot?</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-30.png" alt="Meta Properties" class="wp-image-125309"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator integrates with all of Meta’s major platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Follow these steps to create your very own chatbot:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create a WhatsApp Business app and connect your app to Automator.&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/whatsapp/?utm_source=uncanny_automator&amp;utm_medium=premium-integrations&amp;utm_content=whatsapp">Click here</a>&nbsp;to find the full instructions.</li>



<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-whatsapp-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Download and activate</a>&nbsp;the WhatsApp-powered Click to Chat App on your WordPress website.</li>



<li>Create an Automator recipe for&nbsp;<em>Everyone</em>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>WhatsApp</strong>&nbsp;from the menu of available integrations. From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>A message is received</em>.</li>



<li>In the&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel, click&nbsp;<strong>OpenAI</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<em>Use a prompt to generate text</em>. In the editor, use the&nbsp;<em>WhatsApp Message</em>&nbsp;token as the prompt and click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.</li>



<li>In the&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel, click&nbsp;<strong>Add action</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>WhatsApp</strong>&nbsp;from the menu of available integrations. From the drop-down list, select&nbsp;<em>Send a message to a number</em>. Your recipe should look something like this:</li>
</ol>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Now, with this recipe, every time a student asks a question on your site, Automator will route the question to OpenAI and the student will get an immediate AI-generated answer. For questions about learning content, students can get an immediate—and hopefully helpful—answer instead of waiting for an instructor. It’s like they’ll have their own (virtual) teacher’s assistant!</p>



<p>In the (not-so-distant) future, you’ll be able to train OpenAI on your specific documentation and content so that it can even provide more detailed course and site feedback. Imagine a more dynamic AI that can provide context-sensitive answers, based on your own content!</p>



<p>We’re not quite there yet, but it’s coming soon.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While online learning has myriad benefits, there’s one large problem: how to prevent </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/4-ways-to-fight-cheating-in-elearning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventing cheating in online courses is challenging for a variety of reasons, including limited supervision, technological advancements, pressures to succeed, and a lack of awareness of academic integrity policies.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several common reasons why learners may cheat in online courses. Learners want to do well or need to achieve a certain score to pass, so they’ll look for a backdoor solution to get the score they need. One additional pressure may be the online environment itself. It’s often hard to </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/8-types-of-motivation-for-online-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stay motivated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when learning by yourself at a computer screen, so shortcuts seem even more tempting.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, cheating sometimes occurs because learners may not see any consequence. They may be unaware that the instructor uses anti-cheating or plagiarism-checking software to check their work. In addition, perhaps the academic integrity classroom policies are unclear. You may have assumed learners would never cheat and therefore neglected to include a clear policy for the punishment of doing so.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventing cheating in online courses for children requires a combination of strategies, including clear communication about academic integrity, effective monitoring and detection, and proactive efforts to prevent cheating. It also requires collaboration between educators, parents, and learners to ensure everyone is committed to upholding academic integrity.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not preventing cheating has serious implications. You won’t be able to gain a clear assessment of their abilities. Plus, learners will be unable to demonstrate their learning in other scenarios. Letting learners get away with passing scores can reflect poorly upon your future credibility, too.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s no silver bullet to solving this problem, here are a few of the steps you can take to mitigate it.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-prevent-cheating"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Prevent Cheating&nbsp;</span></h2>



<ol>
<li> <span style="color: var(--global-palette3); font-family: Queens; font-size: 24px;">Build a culture of academic honesty</span> </li>
</ol>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academic integrity ensures fairness, promotes learning, protects credibility, and fosters personal integrity. To start, be sure learners understand what cheating is and why it’s wrong. You could include this in your first unit and make learners acknowledge that they’ve read and understood the policy to hold them accountable. You can even add a discussion forum where students discuss why they think cheating happens and what the consequences could be. Having it out in the open will make it feel socially unacceptable to cheat.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 id="h-1-design-questions-that-require-personal-reflection"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Design questions that require personal reflection&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to cheat when you’re asked to write from personal experience. Ask learners to give examples from their lives in answer to a question. This can work beyond just writing and reading courses. Ask learners for their opinions on whatever your course topic may be, and how they plan to apply that knowledge to the real world. It’s hard for learners to share personal answers, and finding a similar answer online requires enough knowledge of the subject matter to identify the correct example.</span></p>



<h3 id="h-2-use-assessment-strategies-that-make-cheating-difficult"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Use assessment strategies that make cheating difficult</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheating becomes more tempting the higher the stakes are. Making a single test worth half the learner’s final grade can make even well-intentioned folks crack under the pressure. Instead of one big exam, create smaller </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-ways-make-better-quizzes-course/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">micro-quizzes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> throughout the course. A 5-question review quiz isn’t significant enough for learners to try to cheat. And a confident learner who has passed review quizzes won’t risk cheating for a grade they think they can earn.</span></p>



<h3 id="h-3-offer-open-book-exams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Offer open-book exams</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevent learners from searching on Google by letting them use the class materials. Even better: encourage them. Create more difficult questions that are specific to your course topic and would be hard to find online. Your students will still have to research in the book to find the answers they’re looking for—a process that challenges their critical thinking and leads to a richer learning experience. As a bonus, your learners will gain some practical knowledge of how to effectively search for information.</span></p>



<h3 id="h-4-implement-technical-safeguards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Implement technical safeguards</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you suspect a student plagiarizes a written assignment, run it through a plagiarism checker. Randomize quizzes by creating a large question bank. Randomized quizzes prevent students from sharing answers with each other. Set a timer on quizzes so learners who take too long to look up answers won’t have time to finish. Together, these measures make it hard for an individual to cheat without help from multiple peers. And, if you’ve created a culture of integrity, they won’t reach out and ask.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2 id="h-learndash-integrity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash Integrity&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to prevent cheating and protect the integrity of your online course is through the </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/integrity-add-on/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash Integrity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> add-on. Here are a few of the preventative tools included:&nbsp;</span></p>



<ul>
<li><b>Prevent Hotlinking.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hotlinking is the act of stealing someone’s bandwidth or server resources by linking directly to their website’s assets, such as images or videos. Preventing hotlinking can crack down on learners sharing lesson material with others.&nbsp;</span></li>



<li><b>Prevent Concurrent Login</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Concurrent login is when one user with a single username and password logs in at the same time from a different location or device. With this prevention in place. Whenever someone else logs in under the same username/email while the learner is also logged in, they will get an error prompt. This prevents users from sharing logins. Of course, you can also choose to have certain user roles excluded from this feature if needed.</span></li>



<li><b>Prevent Content Copy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This option disables the “Copy” and “Paste” functions on your website, in addition to the entire right-click functionality. Although this is not a foolproof method to prevent copying, this may discourage users from copying and pasting content from your course website.</span></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-protect-your-courses-today"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect Your Courses Today&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you employ all the above strategies, you won’t make cheating impossible, but you will make it impractical.

<p>The benefits of a blended, online learning component in education are too great to ignore.</p>



<p>Many universities are aware of these benefits: about 90% of public institutions offer online classes. Plus,<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=80" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 75% of all college students</a> have taken at least one course online in recent years.</p>



<p>There have been countless studies indicating the benefits of blended elearning environments, and students agree. The<a href="https://research.com/education/online-education-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> vast majority</a> of students agree that online learning is just as good or about the same as in-person instruction.</p>



<p>Technology&#8217;s importance in the classroom and in educational institutions as a whole continues to increase now that blended learning environments have become the norm.</p>



<p>Some of the most impactful benefits of online learning to education institutions include:</p>



<ol>
<li>Increasing student learning by motivation through awards</li>



<li>Reducing the need for physical space, which can increase enrollment size</li>



<li>Many learning styles can be addressed</li>



<li>Economies of scale through the reuse of materials</li>



<li>Reducing overhead by transferring educational activities online</li>
</ol>



<p>Let’s explore each of these factors below.</p>



<h2 id="h-motivation-through-awards">Motivation through awards</h2>



<p>Motivation is<a href="https://www.learndash.com/8-types-of-motivation-for-online-learning/"> a critical component of successful learning</a>. Online learning can keep motivation high through awards and recognition, such as digital badges or certificates. These small digital tokens can encourage learners to stay focused and gamify the learning process a bit. These awards can also be shared on social media, providing learners with a sense of achievement and recognition that can further motivate them to continue learning.</p>



<h2 id="h-increased-enrollment-size">Increased enrollment size</h2>



<p>One of the significant advantages of online learning is the ability to scale up enrollment sizes. Online courses can accommodate larger numbers of learners, with no need for physical classrooms or other overheads that might limit class sizes. This means that online learning platforms can reach more learners and provide education to a broader audience. Larger online classes can also result in a more diverse student body. This can lead to more robust options for discussions, collaboration, and peer learning.</p>



<h2 id="h-variety-of-learning-styles">Variety of learning styles</h2>



<p>Online learning also makes education more accessible to a wider range of learners. Videos, podcasts, and interactive simulations can engage learners and facilitate different learning styles. This variety of learning styles can help ensure that all learners can access the material in ways that are best suited to their needs and preferences. Learners can grasp ideas in a way that makes the most sense to them, with the potential for higher levels of satisfaction.</p>



<h2 id="h-reusable-materials">Reusable materials</h2>



<p>Online learning provides the opportunity to create and reuse educational materials. Materials can be updated and refined over time, making the courses more efficient, effective, and relevant. By reusing materials, online learning platforms can also reduce the time and resources needed to create new courses.</p>



<h2 id="h-reduced-overhead">Reduced overhead</h2>



<p>Online learning platforms do not require physical classrooms, equipment, or other resources that traditional courses need. This can lead to lower costs for enrollment, making education more accessible to a broader range of people. Rather than spending resources on maintaining physical spaces, online classes can focus on delivering high-quality content. This can lead to a more effective and efficient learning experience for both learners and instructors.</p>

<h2 id="h-track-coursework">Track Coursework&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once enrolled in a course, the Reliablesoft Digital Marketing Academy includes a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/user-profiles/">User Profile</a> so learners have an easy way to track and manage their courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the profile page, users can:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>View all enrolled courses</li>



<li>Edit their profile information</li>



<li>Jump back into a course where they left off</li>



<li>View awarded points &amp; quiz grades</li>



<li>Access any certificates they have earned</li>
</ul>



<p>The best way to include a LearnDash profile is to use the block (or shortcode) that comes with LearnDash. No additional plugins are required! You simply create a page on your site and insert the block/shortcode where you want the profile information to appear. And just like that, learners will easily be able to track their progress.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-focus-mode-for-increased-engagement">Focus Mode for Increased Engagement</h2>



<p>Once inside a lesson, the Academy uses <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/focus-mode/">Focus Mode</a> to keep learners engaged. When you enable Focus Mode, the main navigation &amp; footer elements are removed from the page. Course navigation is always visible in a sidebar tray, and course progress is always visible at the top of the screen. A “mark complete” appears as well to help track progress on each lesson page.&nbsp; You can always exit the course easily in the top right navigation bar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Focus Mode aims to eliminate distractions &amp; streamline the learning experience – increasing learning retention and completion rates. The lesson content itself is also optimized by using headers, videos, bullets, and call-out boxes all to promote learning and engagement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every online educator dreams of creating a course that helps learners fulfill their goals. However, taking a course idea and turning it into a thoughtful, engaging experience can be more difficult than it looks. While the hard work is often worth it, going in unprepared can cause many new course designers to feel disheartened. A lot of <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-instructional-design-principles-to-improve-your-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instructional design</a> is about planning a course properly.</p>



<p>Before discouragement sets in, take a look at some likely future setbacks and create an action plan for them now. Knowing how to approach these problems proactively will keep you from being caught off guard. It will also give you the confidence you need to push forward without losing momentum.</p>



<p>Here are the top seven challenges that you may face when designing your first course, paired with the strategies to overcome them.  </p>



<h2 id="h-1-creating-engaging-content-for-learners">1. Creating engaging content for learners</h2>



<p>There is so much content to be made in a course, and it can be a tough job to always be engaging. But it’s worth it: creating engaging content that captures and holds attention can motivate learners and encourage them to stay focused, which can increase their knowledge retention and understanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few ways to make sure your content stays engaging:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tell stories.</strong> Instead of just presenting facts, write out scenarios and examples to convey a message, demonstrate a concept, and engage your audience.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Incorporate interactive elements.</strong> Interactivity can come through forums, community, or gamification (among other things). This could be as simple as asking a question and providing an option to comment, or as complex as adding a quiz or poll. </li>



<li><strong>Use multimedia</strong>. Multimedia elements such as videos, images, and audio clips can liven up a wall of text. They can also help to break up long lessons, making them easier to read.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Keep it brief</strong>. You need to thoughtfully “chunk,” or break up, your lesson content in a digestible way so learners are better able to pace themselves and engage with your content. Use topics, multiple check-ins, and drip feeding to break up your delivery.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-2-difficulty-in-creating-accessible-materials">2. Difficulty in Creating Accessible Materials</h2>



<p>Accessible instructional materials help ensure that all students can access and benefit from the same educational opportunities as their peers. Accessible instructional materials also help learners participate at their own pace and foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for all students.</p>



<p>Being accessible means ditching flashy graphics and fun fonts. Add captions and downloadable transcripts for videos. Make fonts clean and colors minimal. Use alternative text (alt-text) to describe the image and its purpose for visually impaired learners. Use descriptive headings so screen readers can interpret the content. <strong>Take the time to make these a part of your design process now so it becomes second nature. </strong></p>



<h2 id="h-3-difficulty-in-identifying-learning-objectives">3. Difficulty in Identifying Learning Objectives</h2>



<p>Resist the urge to lure people in with generic promises to make them better. You’ll need to be reasonable in what your course can achieve in the amount of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help identify your learning objectives, plan out your major course milestones. These can be the major projects, tests, or achievements in your course. Then, use your milestones to create a course outline. How many lessons are there before the first test, and in between tests, for example? Then, consider the work holistically. What are all of your lessons and milestones really teaching the learner? That’s your course objective, or outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A good way to build towards an objective is to scaffold the learning. Scaffolding introduces new ideas in phases that build upon one another, leading to more complicated work by the end of the course. One learning framework called <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a> outlines how you can scaffold learning objectives:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Remember</li>



<li>Understand</li>



<li>Apply</li>



<li>Analyze</li>



<li>Evaluate</li>



<li>Create</li>
</ol>



<p>With this model, early units are likely to focus on activities that help learners understand concepts, while later units will introduce analyzing, evaluating, and creating, such as in a final project or paper. Using this framework will help ensure that your individual assessments and course milestones are aligned with your course objectives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-4-keeping-up-with-emerging-instructional-tools-and-technology">4. Keeping up with emerging instructional tools and technology</h2>



<p>The educational landscape is constantly changing and evolving. New technologies and pedagogical approaches are emerging all the time. Staying informed will help instructional designers create more effective learning experiences as well as stay ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emerging technologies within the e-learning industry itself are likely to become major differentiators, as some courses stick more visibly to a traditional teaching plan, and others venture into experimental waters. Knowing what your options are—and being prepared to incorporate them if need be—can help you find ways to innovate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep up with emerging tools and technologies, look for workshops and conferences that you can attend. There are always pieces of training, including our own <a href="http://learndash.com/webinars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LearnDash Webinars</a>, that aim to keep course creators ahead of the trend. You can also find and follow relevant blogs and social media accounts in the industry for daily updates. </p>



<h2 id="h-5-designing-for-broad-audiences">5. Designing for broad audiences</h2>



<p>You can’t cover every aspect of your topic for every kind of learner. If you go too wide, your lessons will feel shallow and lack substance. However, if you tighten your audience niche, you can go deeper into the topic, where true learning happens.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/c96lzqQUnBd5-70jzKReJSjnQfqaGqZA2B5oZeQw7GhMRpNsFoV40D-Ulvvb-Bmm2gG1LzV7Zi8Z37P_my7GsKqYKJTN9jB1M88_rTKiflcePMvJprEs_sDMYEulTPgPd-ebIVqjcXRqoeKDXzmeUw" alt="Example of deep &amp; narrow instructional design vs. wide &amp; shallow instructional design"/></figure></div>


<p>To find a niche where you can dive deep, think: What are your credentials or experience in this topic? What special and specific knowledge do you have that others will want to know?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To discover how effective your niche learning is, you’ll need to properly assess your assignments. One of the best tools for assessment is rubrics. Share a rubric with your assignment instructions to help clarify expectations and highlight how the assignment aligns with your learning outcomes. This can be an important measure of how well your learners are understanding course concepts, and if your assignments are hitting the sweet spot of difficulty. </p>



<h2 id="h-6-lack-of-time-and-resources">6. Lack of Time and Resources</h2>



<p>You’d love to spend all the time in the world designing your course, but it’s just not possible. Other course demands, not to mention grading, can take a significant amount of time. </p>



<p>Early in the design process, embrace <a href="https://www.learndash.com/ld-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">templates</a>. Most templates are optimized for online learning and have accessibility features in place. Chunking and scaffolding will come naturally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the class is live, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/automate-course-management-tasks-learndash-zapier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">automate</a> as much as you can. Consider automating weekly email check-ins, feedback after quiz scores, or reminders for due dates. This still gives the learner a personal connection to you without you having to craft dozens of emails. </p>



<h2 id="h-7-supporting-learners-through-the-rough-spots">7. Supporting learners through the rough spots</h2>



<p>Just as you’ll hit some rough spots when designing the course, your learners will also hit some <a href="https://www.learndash.com/does-your-course-suffer-from-learner-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult patches</a>. Be ready with a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-ways-provide-student-support-e-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping hand</a> in the form of check-ins, micro quizzes, and even online office hours where you can schedule a meeting to see how they&#8217;re doing. A little bit of outreach can go a long way.</p>



<p>It isn’t possible to predict all of the challenges you might face in the design process, but these major categories can keep you from stalling out early. Knowing what to expect can keep you on the right path when challenges inevitably arise.</p>



<p>Don’t stop with this list, either. Think about the specific needs and concerns of your learners, and be proactive in addressing them. The more you think about your course from the perspective of your students, the stronger your design will be.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>If you create online courses, you’ve likely heard of instructional design. <a href="https://www.learndash.com/3-instructional-design-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instructional design</a> is the theory and rationale behind how we create courses. It provides a framework for how to design a course to match the way people tend to learn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instructional design is a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/category/instructional-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large field</a>, and there’s a lot to learn. Along the way, you may feel as though you’ll never be ready to launch because your course will never meet all of the standards.</p>



<p>But it’s not about meeting every single standard. In fact, you mainly need to avoid these four instructional design pitfalls:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Lack of clear objectives</li>



<li>Not considering the audience&nbsp;</li>



<li>Overloading content</li>



<li>Neglecting evaluation and feedback&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>If you focus on these four pillars and avoid falling into their trap, you should feel fully confident in your course design.&nbsp; Let’s dive into each of these four areas below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-1-lack-of-clear-learning-objectives">Mistake #1: Lack of Clear Learning Objectives</h2>



<p>A learning objective is the outcome that you want your learners to achieve by the end of your course. Think of a learning objective as one new niche skill or secret to success in your industry that the learner can take with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, the smaller the promise, the better. It will lead to higher learner satisfaction, as it’s more likely that most learners will hit that goal. However, you don’t want to be too specific up front, as it can intimidate learners who may feel they’ll never be able to achieve the goal you’re promising. Instead, aim to create a balanced, true assessment.</p>



<p>Remember: course objectives are achieved by the <em>end</em> of your course, so don’t feel pressured to start covering every topic in unit one. However, each unit should be designed to lead to overall course outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-2-not-considering-the-audience">Mistake #2: Not Considering the Audience</h2>



<p>If you don’t know exactly who your course is for, it’ll feel unfocused and unhelpful. First, ask yourself who your ideal student is. The more clearly you can identify this persona, the easier it is to target their specific needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Find your ideal student by analyzing your audience. Create surveys or ask for feedback on social media. Collect and analyze your responses to determine your average learner. Keep this person in mind as you design your course. It will feel as if it’s written for them, and they’ll be delighted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not knowing your audience will lead to ineffective design. Your lessons will feel too general or try to cover too much at once. Avoid the temptation of having mass appeal. Instead, design for a niche to build authority, gain trust, and increase the perceived value of your course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-3-overloading-on-content">Mistake #3: Overloading on Content</h2>



<p>information overload often happens when instructors get carried away with their material. A lesson with too much content will look overwhelming and deter your learners from ever getting started. You’ll need to thoughtfully “chunk,” or break up, your lesson content in a digestible way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure to structure each lesson around one key point. Start small and then slowly increase more difficult and complicated topics or scenarios. Consider <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-micro-learning-in-your-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro content</a> that can be completed in a matter of minutes, like small activities or quizzes released daily. This helps learners build a pattern of checking in and refreshing their knowledge.</p>



<p>In addition, find ways to introduce different lesson formats. Maybe you have three or four lessons in your usual format, and then have the fifth lesson be a more involved scenario-based design. Alternate the conclusion between a video quiz and a class-based assignment. Either way,&nbsp; mix up your content so that the lessons don’t blend together and start to feel overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-4-neglecting-evaluation-and-feedback">Mistake #4: Neglecting Evaluation and Feedback</h2>



<p>Neglecting to gather feedback and course evaluations will do nothing to help your course. It’s important to know how learners perceive your information. After all, what seems simple and easy for you may not to them, so try to understand from their point of view as much as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To gather feedback, consider using exit surveys or satisfaction polls. Use can use guided questions and ranking scales. Also consider offering a final reflection essay question at the end of your course. This’ll help both you and your learners assess and understand their progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember that feedback is an <a href="https://www.learndash.com/responding-positively-negative-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity for improvement.</a> If you’re hearing that the lessons are too long, break them up. When learners are struggling to pass quizzes, offer shorter, more frequent review quizzes. Or, if learners are dropping out at the same point in your course, check in with them personally and see what support they need to finish.</p>



<p>And if you are getting great feedback, listen to what your learners love and double down.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-work-smarter-with-instructional-design">Work Smarter with Instructional Design&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It’s unlikely your course will ever feel fully finished, but that doesn’t mean it’s not ready. In fact, the more you hold back launching your course, the longer it will take to gather the feedback you need to make it better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you recognize some of these errors in a course you’ve already launched, there’s nothing stopping you from making updates. And if you’re confident your course isn’t committing any of these four major instructional design mistakes, then it’s time to put it in front of learners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an online course creator&#8217;s worst fear.</p>



<p>Spending countless nights working on the most valuable content possible, only to have no one sign up for your course.</p>



<p>Your potential students don&#8217;t receive the education they need to get to that next level, and you don&#8217;t get rewarded for all your hard work.</p>



<p>A lose-lose for everybody  .</p>



<p><strong>But don&#8217;t worry, it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way.</strong></p>



<p>Your course landing page is your opportunity to showcase the value of your course and convince potential students to take the next step and enroll.</p>



<p>If you can direct your audience to a course landing page that&#8217;s optimized for conversions, you&#8217;ll be seeing new signup notifications come in faster than you can swipe them away.</p>



<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll be sharing seven essential elements that every high-converting sales page should include.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-a-compelling-headline-that-communicates-the-benefits-of-your-course">1) A compelling headline that communicates the benefits of your course.</h2>



<p>The first thing your potential students will see is your headline, so it&#8217;s important to spend all the time you need to get this right.</p>



<p>The best course sales page headlines are specific, compelling, and action-oriented.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.handletteringforbeginners.com/better-lettering-course" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-headline-4-1024x627.jpg" alt="Example course headline" class="wp-image-3668"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://ofasignup.com/free-bonuses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-headline-2-1024x808.jpg" alt="Example course headline" class="wp-image-3599"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://learnfigmatowp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-headline-3-1024x505.jpg" alt="Example course headline" class="wp-image-3602"/></a></figure>



<p>It should grab the reader&#8217;s attention, clearly communicate the benefits of your course, and encourage the reader to take action.</p>



<p>What is the outcome you&#8217;re promising your students? And why should they learn this from you as opposed to anywhere else?</p>



<p>Here are some example frameworks you can use to craft your headlines:</p>



<ul>
<li>Discover how to [Achieve a Specific Goal], even if you&#8217;ve never [Common Obstacle] before</li>



<li>How to [Achieve a Specific Goal] in [Timeframe] or less</li>



<li>Master [Topic] in [Timeframe] with [Course Name]</li>



<li>Use the [Method] to Become an Expert [Skill]</li>



<li>Want to [Specific Outcome] but don&#8217;t know where to begin?</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: ask a friend in your target audience if your headline sounds appealing to them. Their answer might surprise you.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-a-comprehensive-description-of-the-course-content-structure">2) A comprehensive description of the course content &amp; structure.</h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got their attention, it&#8217;s time to expand on how you&#8217;ll deliver your promised outcome.</p>



<p>What are your students going to learn? What does the course structure look like? How is the information going to be presented?</p>



<p>This will give potential students a sense of the scope and depth of the course, and help them determine if it&#8217;s a good fit for their needs.</p>



<p>Just be careful to not give away too much of &#8216;the good stuff&#8217; here.</p>



<p>You want to continue focusing on why your content will help them achieve X, without going too deep into the details.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://thefutur.com/course/ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-description-1-1024x636.jpg" alt="Example course description" class="wp-image-3598"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.yourstoryschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-description-3-1024x451.jpg" alt="Example course description" class="wp-image-3606"/></a></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://liftoffcourse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-description-4-1024x906.jpg" alt="Example course description" class="wp-image-3609"/></a></figure>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: come up with a benefit for each module of your course, and use that as the outline for your course description.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-a-clean-and-professional-design">3) A clean and professional design.</h2>



<p>The design of your course landing page says a lot about how you present yourself.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s well-designed and professional, people will be more likely to trust you.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if it&#8217;s cluttered or looks like it was cobbled together in an hour, it might raise questions about the quality of your content.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to take into consideration the audience that you&#8217;re targeting when choosing an aesthetic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://studio.com/classes/david-blaine-card-magic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-design-1-1024x627.jpg" alt="Example of a nicely designed course landing page" class="wp-image-3671"/></a></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re selling a high-end course for business professionals, you&#8217;ll want your landing page to convey a sense of luxury.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re selling a course on gardening, you&#8217;ll want to keep the design light &amp; fun.</p>



<p>Again, if people have a positive experience with your course landing page, they&#8217;re going to see it as an extension of the rest of your course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.kadencewp.com/kadence-theme/starter-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-design-2-1024x627.jpg" alt="Example of a nicely designed course landing page" class="wp-image-3670"/></a></figure>



<p>Getting a nice design doesn&#8217;t need to be expensive either.</p>



<p>There are plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.learndash.com/build-your-course-website-in-record-time-with-kadence-starter-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful pre-built templates</a>&nbsp;available if you&#8217;re looking to get started quickly, or&nbsp;<a href="https://newpulselabs.com/best-figma-ui-kits-web-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-quality UI kits</a>&nbsp;if you want to design something more custom.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: when in doubt, it&#8217;s always better to keep your design simple.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-testimonials-from-happy-customers">4) Testimonials from happy customers.</h2>



<p>Potential students will look for proof that your course actually works, and there&#8217;s no better way to show them than through testimonials.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve had students go through your course before, reach out and ask them if they&#8217;d be willing to provide a short testimonial about their experience (<a href="https://newpulselabs.com/testimonial-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a great tool</a>&nbsp;that makes this entire process easy).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to get in the habit of writing these testimonials down or saving screenshots any time you see someone mention your course positively.</p>



<p>That way you&#8217;ll slowly build a repository of testimonials you can use throughout your ads, landing pages, checkout pages, email sequences etc.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.thedesignership.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-testimonials-1-1024x504.jpg" alt="Example course testimonials" class="wp-image-3604"/></a></figure>



<p>If you don&#8217;t currently have any testimonials, don&#8217;t worry! You still have a couple options when first starting out.</p>



<p>A) You can offer course access for a hefty discount to anyone who is willing to provide a testimonial in return.</p>



<p>B) You can showcase testimonials of people you&#8217;ve worked with in the past. They only need to comment on your expertise in your niche, and not necessarily the contents of your course.</p>



<p>You can then sprinkle in more course-specific testimonials over time as more students are enrolled.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: you can never have too many testimonials on a page!</p>



<h2 id="h-5-a-clear-and-enticing-call-to-action-cta">5) A clear and enticing call-to-action (CTA).</h2>



<p>Now that your visitor understands how they&#8217;ll benefit from taking your course, it&#8217;s time to get them to take action.</p>



<p>This is generally via a button that takes the user to your course checkout page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-cta-3-1024x380.jpg" alt="Example course CTA" class="wp-image-3673"/></figure>



<p>While this sounds straightforward, there are a couple mistakes we see people make often.</p>



<p><strong>A) They don&#8217;t use enough CTAs.</strong></p>



<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure you present multiple opportunities throughout the page for your reader to take the next step.</p>



<p>Some people will be ready to sign up after reading your headline. Some will be ready after going through your course description. And others after they&#8217;ve gone through all testimonials.</p>



<p>Including multiple CTAs on your page makes it easier for them to take action the moment they&#8217;re ready.</p>



<p><strong>B) They use a generic call-to-action.</strong></p>



<p>You&#8217;ll often see a button with the text &#8220;Get Started&#8221; or &#8220;Sign Up&#8221;.</p>



<p>While this is still far better than nothing, it misses out on the opportunity to give your potential student that final push.</p>



<p>Try tying your selling proposition back into your CTAs.</p>



<p>You can do this through the button text itself, or by including a subheading right above your button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://liveoffyourpassion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-cta-1-1024x335.jpg" alt="Example course CTA" class="wp-image-3597"/></a></figure>



<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: you can use different CTAs throughout your page. Just make sure they all point to the same destination.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-a-money-back-guarantee-to-reduce-risk-for-your-student">6) A money-back guarantee to reduce risk for your student.</h2>



<p>If there&#8217;s anything stopping someone from purchasing your course, it&#8217;s the fear that they could potentially waste their time and money.</p>



<p>The more you can remove any risk from their purchase, the more likely they&#8217;ll be to sign up.</p>



<p>A common way course creators do this is through a money-back guarantee.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://habitsacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-guarantee-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Example course money-back guarantee" class="wp-image-3674"/></a></figure>



<p>Depending on what you&#8217;re teaching, there may be a couple different approaches you can use for a money-back guarantee.</p>



<p><strong>A) You can offer an *unconditional 14-day money-back guarantee.</strong></p>



<p>This option reduces risk for your student the most, as they&#8217;ll feel they have the freedom to change their mind after making the purchase.</p>



<p>The downside is that you may have students who take advantage of the guarantee &#8211; getting value from all the lessons, and then requesting a refund simply to get their money back.</p>



<p><strong>B) You can offer a *conditional 60-day money-back guarantee.</strong></p>



<p>This option often requires the student to show some kind of proof that the course didn&#8217;t work for them.</p>



<p>They tried the methods that you taught, but didn&#8217;t get the result you promised.</p>



<p>This will help prevent students from taking advantage of your money-back guarantee.</p>



<p>The downside is that since your student isn&#8217;t guaranteed a refund, this doesn&#8217;t reduce as much risk as option A.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip:&nbsp;</strong>don&#8217;t be afraid to experiment with different money-back guarantees to see how they impact your bottom line.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-a-personable-instructor-bio">7) A personable instructor bio.</h2>



<p>Courses are a highly personal experience.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just as important for your student to resonate with you as it is for them to resonate with your content.</p>



<p>By including a section about yourself (and any other instructors) on your landing page, you&#8217;re giving your potential student a chance to connect with you.</p>



<p>If you share the story of how you&#8217;ve come to be in the position you&#8217;re now in, they&#8217;re more likely to draw similarities to their own lives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://theartisandesigner.com/elevate-your-design-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/course-page-bio-1-1024x559.jpg" alt="Example course bio" class="wp-image-3611"/></a></figure>



<p>Done right, a good bio will go a long way in building trust and credibility for your potential student.</p>



<p><strong>Helpful tip:&nbsp;</strong>don&#8217;t be shy to inject your personality alongside your accomplishments. You don&#8217;t want to make it sound like a robot wrote your bio!</p>



<h2 id="h-wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>Now that you know the key components of a successful course landing page, it&#8217;s time to make magic happen!</p>



<p>Fine-tune your design &amp; copy so that you&#8217;re effectively communicating what life will look like for your student after they&#8217;ve finished your course.</p>



<p>And be sure to include multiple calls-to-action throughout your page so that they have plenty of opportunities to take the next step.</p>



<p>With these elements in place, you can be confident that your course content will reach the most number of students possible.</p>



<p><strong>A win-win for everyone</strong>&nbsp; .</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all for this one.</p>



<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>This month’s Customer Showcase is <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast</a>, the popular SEO WordPress plugin. With the slogan “SEO for Everyone,” Yoast has a reputation for being at the forefront of the SEO industry.</p>



<p>When Yoast decided to launch their academy to empower users on SEO best practices, they needed an LMS they could depend on. Yoast turned to LearnDash to build impressive courses to show WordPress users how to understand SEO best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s explore how Yoast uses LearnDash to ensure a reliable and impressive online course experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-seo-for-everyone">SEO for Everyone&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When you land on Yoast’s course page, <a href="https://yoast.com/academy/">Yoast Academy</a>, you’ll see two ways to enroll in courses. Many of Yoast’s SEO courses are free and only require email registration.</p>



<p>The option to require an email can be set in LearnDash’s <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/courses/course-access/">Course Access</a> Settings. When you set a course to Free (as opposed to Open), it requires users to register and allows you to customize a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/login-registration/">login &amp; registration</a> page to collect emails.</p>



<p>Yoast’s Premium courses use LearnDash’s Recurring Course Access feature, billed yearly. You can set this up in LearnDash with <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/settings/paypal-settings/">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/settings/stripe-connect/">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/2checkout/">2Checkout</a>, or <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/settings/razorpay-integration/">Razorpay</a> as your payment gateway and choose how often you’d like the recurring course access to renew. You can also use this option to offer a free trial, which’ll turn into a recurring subscription after a fixed period of time.</p>

<h2 id="h-courses-at-a-glance">Courses at a glance</h2>



<p>When you click “Go to Yoast SEO Academy,” you can see all course offerings thanks to LearnDash’s <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/course-grid/">Course Grid</a> add-on. This provides an easy way to browse the course library in a streamlined grid format. You can add a course grid to any page via the block editor or through a shortcode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding a Course Grid also allows you to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Customize the number and sort order of courses</li><li>Filter courses by category or tag, or show only enrolled courses</li><li>Show/hide Images, descriptions, and a video preview&nbsp;</li><li>Customize buttons and CTA text</li><li>And more!&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/uV7KlUxBYxkXLQmkMeZeh-UkETYlAFI83EsLT9nouTvebOcUtkCdqzxRb7OWWdNjX_5D8-1BVanFPFdfNU27v_KKKRbAOumowe_jszJOLK-YTc91SYof7yD2R3B5JN4630yueB92EKtBAYF70Ys4gdByGz9uyGLGcHn_lzRHdTI5XkIHObyyHmgnft6MPw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-thoughtfully-designed">Thoughtfully Designed</h2>



<p>Each course in Yoast’s academy was thoughtfully designed by expert instructional designers. They make the most of LearnDash’s extensive features to ensure learners are engaged throughout the entire course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Yoast Academy uses <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-focus-mode-in-learndash-3-0-benefits-learners/">Focus Mode</a>, which eliminates distractions and adds a progress bar to the course. This small gamification feature can encourage users to continue until they see that progress bar filled to 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The course content widget on the right-hand side is another essential Focus Mode feature. It provides a learner with a complete overview of the course content, including the number of topics and quizzes. You can expand each lesson to preview the topics before you get started.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you click on a course, the first lesson appears right away. There are clear course outcomes that begin each lesson, with introductory videos, embedded, documents, and a custom quiz. Each step of the lesson is clear and actionable, thanks in part to LearnDash’s educational-focused features.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/B0q5aLdscDvzgtjyNU2CYitWAI2KgJQTtbITsMAKmIjmDIcnwFnfmJQJPE_aFDxlX5XjCAT4I8f_hkarj8BJyHjtvKAmhKPJO1iA74Gw88COOMifj343luFrLXacEb8QS1Vwm8XWf6VwuEgLF16a8KG1JqI6qhPqvNC5vLv8X1STQfOFXM7ROpoMjVBWHQ.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-do-more-with-learndash">Do More With LearnDash</h2>



<p>Yoast turned to LearnDash to offer a full library of courses on SEO optimization, copywriting, configuration, and even multilingual SEO. More than 20,000 students have gone through Yoast&#8217;s academy, powered by LearnDash. </p>



<p>“Learndash has allowed Yoast Academy to create much more meaningful exercises,&#8221; says Joost de Valk from Yoast. &#8220;In the past, we could only dream of having users complete lines of code to test and perfect their SEO skills. This is what learning is about!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">&nbsp;As an online educator, there are so many small tasks that constantly need to be done: updating, posting, notifications, email – the list goes on!&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can easily fill an afternoon with busy work and still feel behind. When do you find the time to engage with learners and keep innovating your content? Not to mention marketing and selling courses as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter automation. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/online-schooling/5-automations-that-are-revolutionizing-e-learning/articleshow/94526155.cms">Automation is a popular strategy in elearning</a>, as it helps cut down on tedious tasks like enrollment, notifications, and giving/removing access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the best ways to introduce automation is by using <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>. Hailed as “easy automation for busy people,” Zapier moves info between your web apps automatically, so you can focus on your most important work.&nbsp;Zapier uses a workflow called “Zaps” that connects your apps to automate repetitive tasks. A <em>trigger</em> is an event that starts a Zap, and an <em>action</em> is an event a Zap performs. The easy way to think of it is: “When this happens, do that.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-set-up-automations-with-learndash-and-zapier">How to Set Up Automations with LearnDash and Zapier</h2>



<p>To connect LearnDash-related activities to Zapier, all you need is our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/zapier-integration/">free Zapier add-on</a>. Once installed, you have literally hundreds of apps available to connect to for your online courses. This is perfect if you are already using some of these tools for your business and want to integrate your LearnDash courses into them.</p>



<p>There are several triggers and actions around your LearnDash site that can trigger a zap. Here are a few of the supported triggers:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A learner enrolls in or completes a course</li>



<li>A learner is added to a new group or leaves a group</li>



<li>An essay or assignment is submitted</li>



<li>A Lesson, Quiz, or Topic is completed</li>



<li>A user completes all courses in one group</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-tips-for-successful-elearning-automation">Tips for successful eLearning automation</h2>



<p>To get the most out of your automation, you should plan your Zaps out first. Think about what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish and break down the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve. Ask:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>What apps do I want to use? (LearnDash and Mailchimp, for example)&nbsp;</li>



<li>What event will trigger my Zap? (a new learner enrolls)&nbsp;</li>



<li>What event will my Zap perform?&nbsp; (a welcome email is automatically sent)&nbsp;</li>



<li>What information do I want to move between those apps? (The contact’s name, email address, and the course name).</li>
</ul>



<p>Zapier keeps track of all the tasks your Zaps attempt. You can see which tasks were successful and unsuccessful. To maintain your automation, here are a few best practices to follow:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>After making any changes, test the automation with sample data to ensure it is still working as expected.</li>



<li>Document any changes or updates made to the automation for future reference.</li>



<li>Keep the automation simple and only include the necessary steps to achieve the desired outcome.</li>



<li>Keep an eye on the usage and performance of the automation to identify and address any potential bottlenecks.</li>



<li>Use<a href="https://platform.zapier.com/docs/versions"> version control</a> if needed for your Zaps to have a clear change log and roll back if necessary.</li>



<li>Use Multi-Step Zaps to split a complex Zap into smaller, more manageable parts.</li>



<li>Keep an eye on the usage limits of your apps to avoid hitting the limit and breaking the zaps.</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone selling a course online knows the importance of a sales page that converts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your online course sales page has one main goal – to persuade the reader to enroll in your online course. It’s where a visitor turns into a buyer.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deciding on the look and feel of your sales page relies on how you’re planning to sell your course. For example, will you use a shopping cart, a membership plugin, or a </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/settings/payments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">built-in LearnDash payment system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Will there be testimonials and videos too?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dive into what your course sales page should cover before exploring options for building a winning sales page.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2 id="h-the-anatomy-of-a-course-sales-page"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Anatomy of a Course Sales Page&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><b>Headline &amp; Subtitle&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good headline and subtitle will grab your reader’s attention, convey the goal of your online course, and hook your reader into wanting more.&nbsp; It needs to be concise, clear, and descriptive. Think like your ideal student, and write in their language. Be brief, targeted, and focus on the benefits.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>Course Description</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a short statement about the expected results of your course. It should communicate what the course is and share the key benefits. You could list out the modules, lesson plans, and any bonus (or extra) course materials, so readers get a peek before purchasing.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>Imagery</b> <b>&amp; Video</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using high-quality images and videos helps break up your copy and can sometimes show your reader results from taking your online course. Make sure your header is high-quality and relevant. You can include mockups of what the main page or lesson plans look like, too. Consider adding videos of yourself or students talking about your courses.</span></p>



<p><b>Social proof</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks love reading reviews before buying a product. They want to know if other people had a good experience before they spend. You can incorporate social proof through testimonials, data from users, or brand logos from publications you&#8217;ve been featured in.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>Pricing&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your sales page is an obvious and necessary place to talk about pricing. This section should be clear and straightforward.&nbsp; List out your price and show what’s included in the cost. If possible, offer different ways to pay for your course, such as full or monthly payments. Ensure folks that transactions are secure and that there’s a risk reversal, such as a money-back guarantee.</span></p>



<p><b>FAQs</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before there’s even a chance for buyers to get skeptical, give them answers to some of the most common questions they might have.&nbsp; Share 5 to 10 most common questions readers might have and include a way for folks to contact you if there’s a question that’s not listed.</span></p>



<p><b>CTAs</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide multiple opportunities to take action. Your CTA buttons need to be prominent, bold, and in more places than the bottom of your page. The text should be simple and actionable. Use colors that pop so your buttons stand out from the rest of your sales page.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-creating-a-course-sales-page"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a Course Sales Page&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flexibility of WordPress offers plenty of options for creating high-impact sales pages for your courses.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there are a variety of options available, we think the best way to create a sales page is through a page builder like </span><a href="http://kadencewp.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kadence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/elementor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elementor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both Kadence and Elementor have a vast library of templates and sections for creating a course website for the non-designer. Plus, both Kadence and Elementor come with pre-made templates and widgets made exclusively for LearnDash.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using LearnDash with a page builder does introduce a few additional settings to keep in mind, so make sure to review these </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/page-builders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when using a page builder.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using LearnDash to add courses and lessons to your WordPress site, then you know that organizing and displaying learning resources is essential. Most courses need extra resources to boost students’ learning, such as course handbook or other downloadable materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s easy enough to manually list a few links within a course or lesson. However, this becomes unmanageable if you need to display larger numbers of resources. Students might need a quicker way to find specific items.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thankfully, there is a solution with the <a href="https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Document Library Pro</a> plugin. This tool allows you to create a searchable database of learning resources that can be easily accessed by your students from within a LearnDash course or lesson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combining the plugin with LearnDash helps you to:</p>



<ul><li>Enhance the user experience by providing a centralized location for all course resources.</li><li>Increase the ability to search and filter materials, making it easier for students to find what they need.</li><li>Add resource version control to your existing <a href="https://www.learndash.com/8-metrics-every-course-creator-should-track/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tracking and reporting capabilities</a>, allowing instructors to know which learning materials were available when.</li></ul>



<p>We&#8217;ll show you how to use the Document Library Pro plugin to add LearnDash course materials to a searchable database within a course or lesson.</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-left" id="h-best-wordpress-plugin-for-adding-learndash-course-materials">Best WordPress Plugin for Adding LearnDash Course Materials</h3>



<p>As well as adding LearnDash course materials library to your site, Document Library Pro allows you to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Display LearnDash course materials anywhere on your site. </strong>Use the default plugin shortcodes to display your resources on the main course page, the &#8216;Materials&#8217; tab, the course sidebar, or even within individual lessons.</li><li><strong>Display the resources in a table or grid.</strong> The table layout is recommended for large numbers of resources, while the grid view is ideal for smaller collections of materials.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Offer advanced search, filtering, and sorting features. </strong>Your students can now use an optional search box to locate specific learning materials faster. They also get powerful sorting and filtering functionality.</li><li><strong>File downloads and third-party website links. </strong>You can embed all sorts of downloadable files including PDFs, audio, and video files. Students can also follow links to third-party websites for further learning.</li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="602" height="471" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/aVST_nhr9NIGqtJn-TJaCkvTh44UTB7w-rwcmdl-rs7EEmQK0aXsqSqAZKYZVI4Y0p4_ED2aKFXvMVm784VjYFDUUZHa9ITYDeOXQ86D4AsbIehiQBq4Em0fPm2sbJoaFQNXK8m2MO_8-jo8DwsJlMBfR2r6eMmUzgIdaD8n2dB3gEKqUIxT838.jpeg"></p>



<p>To add these powerful features to your LearnDash courses, follow the steps below.</p>



<h4 id="h-step-1-install-and-activate-document-library-pro">Step 1: Install and Activate Document Library Pro</h4>



<p>To enable search in your <a href="https://barn2.com/learndash-resource-library-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LearnDash course materials library</a>, you need to install and activate the plugin. <a href="https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Get your copy of Document Library Pro</a> to receive a downloadable ZIP file link and license key in your email.</p>



<p>In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload Plugin</strong>. Select the plugin ZIP file and click <strong>Install Now</strong> followed by <strong>Activate Plugin</strong>. Follow the setup wizard’s instructions and enter your license key and default settings for your course materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pay attention to the <strong>Columns </strong>and <strong>Document filters </strong>options. The Columns option controls what information to display about each course material or resource. For example, you might want to show its title, a brief excerpt, the categories, and a link to download (or to view on a third party site, depending on the type of course material).&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also enable searching and filtering if you want your site users to search LearnDash course materials. This allows you to go beyond listing a few course materials in a specific site location.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/XfWLn3ktBSH2M2izQEGucg0NVtnUs1EUoXbfDNKn1qoCeB9XQKLWQ193naNhKf8rYxEamxXtjfY5L8ba8ENPJYiJQSWbg-bajpyYXxBJdBFfRUucS_HalFOG5r6dmFqlUDn_pzEvpyrJSB0ky_TtE7TTlVKYHtc8unFjcdzt4XZf-mSYO4QqNH8.png" width="602" height="401"></p>



<p>You can also begin tweaking more features:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Customize the style of download links.</li><li>Enable instant previews, so that people can access course materials without having to download them.</li><li>Add advanced sorting and filtering options.</li><li>Control the elements above and below the table or grid.</li><li>Customize mobile visibility and responsive options.</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-step-2-add-learndash-course-materials-to-your-site">Step 2: Add LearnDash Course Materials to Your Site</h4>



<p>You can add LearnDash course materials to WordPress in bulk, or one by one. To add course materials to LearnDash individually, go to <strong>Documents &gt; Add New</strong>. This works like adding a new WordPress post.</p>



<p>Add the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/why-think-about-course-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">course material’s title</a> and description. In the <strong>Document Link </strong>tab, you can either upload a file directly to the WordPress Media Library or add a third-party URL link.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/L6UfYBGvonSYc-IpX4b7TY9UNOs1qj4NAL-hC6uCgYCpZy9UGt0QlDTQ8mCs9EDww4KaR3Qfqs-w5QpUD_REGyytkn1BZyNcxiObOb_KEUZJGDraaPlKaJ0zu40-_G-EyA-zPKpuuldrJi5CH9pdIgcY9DAwuUC5Oh-u1XbynvrlI_vGPDLouho.png" width="602" height="369"></p>



<p>To add LearnDash course materials in bulk, navigate to <strong>Documents &gt; Import</strong>. Here you can either drag and drop multiple document files into the upload area or do a bulk CSV file upload.</p>



<p>Once you’ve added LearnDash course materials to your site, let’s display them in the appropriate courses and lessons.</p>



<h4 id="h-step-3-add-learndash-course-materials-using-a-shortcode">Step 3: Add LearnDash Course Materials Using a Shortcode</h4>



<p>With Document Library Pro, you use a shortcode to list your newly added LearnDash course materials. The plugin offers <a href="https://barn2.com/kb/document-library-options/?utm_source=barn2&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=text&amp;utm_content=learndash-resource-library-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 50 shortcode options</a>. You also get to decide what they should look like.</p>



<p>The basic plugin shortcode for listing LearnDash course materials is [doc_library]. This will list all the course materials on your site, with the settings that you selected in the setup wizard.</p>



<p>If you have more than one course, or if you want to list different course materials in other lessons, then you need to tell the shortcode which materials to display. To add LearnDash course materials this way, you can use shortcodes like:</p>



<ul><li>[doc_library doc_category=&#8221;wordpress&#8221;] &#8211; This will list only course materials in the “WordPress” category.</li><li>[doc_library doc_tag=&#8221;woocommerce,bogo&#8221;] &#8211; This displays all the resources tagged &#8220;woocommerce” and “bogo&#8221;.</li></ul>



<p>Once you’ve planned out your shortcodes, you can start adding them to your courses. Let’s walk you through some of the most popular options.</p>



<h4 id="h-adding-a-searchable-resource-library-to-the-main-learndash-course-page">Adding a Searchable Resource Library to the Main LearnDash Course Page</h4>



<p>Since you’re adding additional materials to individual courses, it makes sense to display them directly on the course’s homepage. This creates a central resource library for the entier LearnDash course. The most popular position for this would be below the course overview section.</p>



<p>To do this, go to <strong>LearnDash LMS &gt; Courses </strong>and hover over the course you want to add materials to. Then click <strong>Edit</strong>. On the &#8216;Edit Course&#8217; screen, scroll down to the main description and add a shortcode block.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="602" height="272" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/BssnrLVQFoJ0xuqnp79qsXpF3fFkczxUoQjt0kZsFCGIR2kvJnNVTRRZtKcc40QH9dX3FUpExFCd_gKK1f-Cj2xKFYRXwhmtA_jK9Kne0GBgvfuFxDD7ovXjQ2HpCOxy2dKoUdAhBgnjUcPi9PDA9rNg3qr_2QHqfcXmn4UQLGEoRvvQ8dKuUJI.png"></p>



<p>Then paste the Document Library Pro shortcode where you want to display the course resource library. Click <strong>Preview </strong>to check out the results in a new tab. Your first LearnDash course materials library should look something like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="504" height="495" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Alm5PaYzhqcrCiVHw1DSW9wQk8uG2EBOAslvlopMWOJ-E_36WfDaYLl9kcD85DzEU9YULKyjOhuLNyzO4yv1dnL9LPGotWJhHateUzxLqDZ9w2nXPv6ti71I63OQyUe2UeoeSET1dopMGg2Xrv9LnOU5CU21MOiUXQwCfjGEDcYvle-y_N2rcSg.png"></p>



<h4 id="h-add-learndash-course-materials-to-the-materials-tab">Add LearnDash Course Materials to the Materials Tab</h4>



<p>Another option is to display your LearnDash course materials library in the ‘Course Materials’ tab. The LearnDash &#8216;Course Materials&#8217; tab could be an ideal location to display all the materials for a particular course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To add the materials here, navigate to the <strong>Settings </strong>tab of the ‘Edit Course’ page. Scroll down to the <strong>Display and Content Options </strong>section. Toggle on <strong>Course Materials</strong> and enter the Document Library Pro shortcode.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/jn-tX0_jYAqQPS3W-BJ4Q_F06sCqqbNXxekfKPVFDOYKxhMEdCD4HzBaTOwY0y5tCW1xsiSBmJMZVtqjNIeB7VOcVRMpICQSRlImFU0uviB7PDnoX0Lzt92pRd4a11oXBxisBhUsqKaGWrCp9FhluLONUGF2XDxMdvyfCSvvLFVg03eKNqQQvFs.png" width="602" height="341"></p>



<p>Now, the course materials tab will have a resource library that looks like this.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="520" height="482" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/lzjHHSf8eT8pvjtqERMPRXJlxCeLnMkqUl0qgs961oo8tmJ5O8OQs9gDtrZWZzhPsbhHozuv5TPowyY4r6tXT0C6aMmUQ4R1xbDlRhKFPIKR5mbdv4sQrxXEW_bY_bkwRB-liAuCJA44_pUBawmmGsbkCGVJwRxY_NEhY3aiqPOLvboFK65x2qg.png"></p>



<h4 id="h-add-learndash-course-materials-to-the-course-sidebar">Add LearnDash Course Materials to the Course Sidebar</h4>



<p>Alternatively, you can make your LearnDash course materials even more accessible by displaying them in the course sidebar. The good thing about adding LearnDash course materials to the course sidebar is that they will be visible on all the course and lesson pages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this, simply go to <strong>Appearance &gt; Widgets</strong> and add a shortcode block to the sidebar widget. If you want to apply the sidebar display to only specific course pages, you can use a free plugin like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Widget Options</a>. It allows you to choose which courses and lessons to display the widgets on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/CJfukIIR3l_Va6o7j5Y3bM0IIgvSGKYvJboADwk7sB5r3hPPi0nvSRnD_TCRSyKVsazFigXxym9FZSC2a-u6mD97qfkVaAhebvscwQiAdSKER0sjsWHX8dewYi7Bsa9-juaH-kweeK7J3R7x0MtNc_MuTsiqIqXpEl_eckBq522WvNH57Km2wW4.jpeg" width="602" height="311"></p>



<h4 id="h-add-learndash-course-materials-to-individual-lessons">Add LearnDash Course Materials to Individual Lessons</h4>



<p>There are also common use cases for adding course materials to individual Learndash lessons. This can be useful if each lesson has unique additional resources like audio tracks and lesson notes. You can easily showcase these materials at the end of any lesson or even include a ‘Further Resources’ lesson at the end of the course.</p>



<p>You can do this by going to <strong>LearnDash &gt; Lessons</strong>. Create a new lesson or edit an existing one. Then add a Document Library Pro shortcode block at the bottom of the content.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/eT9a82do0o-BMmi38Whh4Jo9u7dxOQOJKc7if1c96pOa8uaMWDS4mLVM43rHtANFCpgHoCDwLCHUUKyIfECPzFvjQxpPN33JuSc_TsVsn9VEh-C_d7-PBRqY3q2YkbQkCZtv6TvU2g7ezPbxP3KVD4hBbqUpIRc8NY_unbgf_FcLRgALvptqYo.png" width="602" height="380"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/yp5PBSl9G4Dfr_gF7LFVmYHGHbuwABFFf8hY8fgauNfE9eAmFvUa9waH9rpoXR8NJevKwJXFzwhhsiyUb1wNY0-TKbsadtdPGn8TZVkErX01kq4vZlhUoeuDS57IXvcGqsMYylIWfHT2ftqHl_EWNCgHqFIqLX98oA-BAfssekudT-8QwyQbuQ4.jpeg" width="602" height="415"></p>



<h3 id="h-extra-customization-options-for-your-learndash-course-materials-library">Extra Customization Options for Your LearnDash Course Materials Library</h3>



<p>Document Library Pro allows you to customize your library’s look and feel in different ways. For example, you can choose to display your course materials in a grid rather than a table. All you need to do is navigate to <strong>Document &gt; Settings </strong>and scroll down to the <strong>Default layout </strong>section and check <strong>Grid</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/ap-Et4pCFt0UF2PgZR-yvsL_Nyu-gRaxJuqI7gzN3NL37K0g_u2jSplv5tPYUlZMx7JWxtLmWHOq3xvsUmmFHbqeW3plG-OdzCthN9MtuqaAWJCGmgEPvG02rfI3_3FJjiuhvrH6ckwBrEsq9uHWLtb3nStMnm42L1laP4Gyly4gOjJLNguVBQ.png" width="602" height="344"></p>



<p>Here’s what the results should look like:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Ci2NI09S_yMdBznt1KgLFvKAF6sFCe2SK7z46c0rQMCx4afX0uSXg7pnu4k_IAiaFOVKcAVL_t9f9Gv3WRZc9woUt-H4VFHfHyuce6Ey0hPy8wnFOmNhBTiBA1_bYwpvomVX9AEkuPn4ZE-npHLuOxjuL1t5qFODp17dQ8Yohbe3LqbUH9emG_w.png" width="602" height="325"></p>



<p>Similarly, you can enable folder view on the same page by checking <strong>Display the document library in folders</strong>. This is a perfect way to create a well-organized hierarchical structure for eLearning sites with multiple course materials categories.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/lUAdqeZqTSNCRg_k2HEyYsJMe1YVQWjNiWN7L-0lnQIBA2VQZH3Ong_eCZAzoPDD87GvZmzPQOpWmBnBiuWK9RtZMIyIWRECgf7qcLnmcs9ZKcRT6LpODDKUu4gJGubPlUZhO75Fw4Qp-IZmxouA1zesib-_JC6fCFu1H1C3nLGQoEMLY7f84uA.png" width="602" height="232"></p>



<p>Another important feature is the search function. You can include the search box above or below the course materials list, or both. Alternatively, you can even hide the feature completely and display it somewhere else using a shortcode or widget.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/L2boEd4gbdfP2Py0zCIGeB16q8pwchLc5fkAU4XRtLUNDmaC-bam6plDyRuzNkmkss9qadhePwdJULA_txK_HLqaQHHeUsVPItKjSzf2MemZ-ylJcl_UoX5EiigG_mEn65jr3gFZOr3l6bmWQPVF-BXMa1XXehPr_xnEDLsFfRYHPXnWB2ksB50.png" width="602" height="227"></p>



<h3 id="h-improve-your-learndash-site-with-a-searchable-course-materials-library">Improve Your LearnDash Site With a Searchable Course Materials Library&nbsp;</h3>

By adding in a sense of accomplishment or competition, learners will be driven to complete milestones to see their reward.</p>
<p>Gamification is a widely used tool in education. Gamification, which is the use of game elements in non-game contexts, helps engage folks in otherwise routine tasks. Since the early 2000s, the gamification trend has exploded, becoming a dominant strategy.</p>
<p>Let’s explore how educational games can promote motivation and how to add those features to your WordPress course.</p>
<h2>The role of educational games</h2>
<p>Studies show that<a href="https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/intrinsic-motivation-gamification/#:~:text=This%20helps%20them%20see%20they,the%20progress%20they're%20making."> gamification helps improve intrinsic motivation</a>. By engaging learners in choices and challenges, you’ll unlock a desire to complete tasks to feel a sense of accomplishment.  In addition, gamification can ignite the competitive human spirit. The idea of winning or being the “best” can motivate learners to take part.</p>
<p>One of the main <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-to-use-gamification-in-e-learning/">benefits of gamification</a> is that it’s fun. And when activities are fun, we don’t think twice about sticking with it. Think about grades: few of us would think of grades as fun. But grades are like trying to achieve a high score on a leaderboard. Gamification tells learners that scores are temporary. They can try again and keep improving. This will motivate learners to do better next time.</p>
<p>Gamification also helps learners<a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-gamification-helps-learners-achieve-flow/"> achieve flow</a>. Flow is also known as “effortless attention.” This can engage learners for longer, reduce learning fatigue, and improve the learning experience. Flow, however, is not a passive activity. It requires active participation, which can be triggered by the challenge and engagement of a game.</p>
<p>In short, a good game hits that sweet spot between boring and impossible.</p>
<h2>Gamification Solutions</h2>

<p>This month’s Customer Showcase is Bitesize Bio – a community platform that brings bioscientists together to share experience, wisdom, and insight. Bitesize Bio’s mission is to facilitate better science by improving scientists’ technical skills, scientific fundamentals, personal development and wellbeing, careers, and funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitesize Bio support their mission by empowering their community to share advice, tips, practical experience, training, knowledge, and insights from hundreds of scientists worldwide. This information is provided through informative articles, webinars, podcasts — and courses created by LearnDash, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s explore how Bitesize Bio uses LearnDash to make practical knowledge and training information accessible, understandable, and actionable for their community of scientists.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-home-page">The Home Page</h2>



<p>Right away, on Bitesize Bio’s homepage, you’ll see their courses advertised at the top of their page. The banner entices the user to enroll by revealing the benefits of the course. With a promise to improve a tangible skill important to many academics and scientists, it’s hard not to click the enroll button! </p>



<p>Following their course banner are dozens of articles, podcast episodes, and resources open and available to anyone interested in them. The abundance of resources on the homepage entices the user to find out more about their course offerings  – they show the site as a reputable source of information. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="685" height="1701.8488153421017" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/WJJHO7sykDj6rKJBMbpJN8uCHS7wBBt0GSD9WAEC8p_b4K8LHxSQROsz9DCGyqzMoWdJ-L01MM5lk2sT-0q6UvqYb_gSwGuTwkyn4duPvHjk07kQH2DYElZu0aF0QB_1n7PEU0-KSlsL_LXfJ7o-IGK8_cT3fJij5xBE67I_ciB0SByCzMj8w299D65t.png"></p>



<h2 id="h-learndash-in-action">LearnDash In Action</h2>



<p>When you click “enroll,” you’re taken to the course landing page. Bitesize Bio makes use of LearnDash’s <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/core/courses/course-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Course Access Setting</a> to allow users to register and gain access to their course without payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Course access settings allow you to define a set of criteria for how a user gains and maintains access to your course. You can set a course as completely open, free with registration required, one-time payment, recurring subscription, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When setting a course to free, no payment is required, but a user must be registered/logged in to access. The Free access mode is a good choice if you want to manually enroll students into the course and capture their emails. With an email list, you can send out newsletters advertising your other course offerings as soon as they become available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re using LearnDash’s customized <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/login-registration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">login &amp; registration</a> along with your course access settings, you can change your language on the registration button, as Bitesize Bio has done. They’ve changed their text to say “I’d Like to Join this Course” to happily welcome folks into their free course. </p>

<h2 id="h-focus-mode-keeps-learners-engaged">Focus Mode Keeps Learners Engaged</h2>



<p>Once inside the course, Bitesize Bio makes use of our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/focus-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Focus Mode</a> feature. Focus Mode aims to eliminate distractions &amp; streamline your user’s learning experience – increasing learning retention and completion rates.</p>



<p>When you enable Focus Mode, your main navigation and footer elements are removed from the page. Course navigation is always visible in a sidebar tray, as well as course progress at the top of the screen. Control movement through the course with Next/Previous, Mark Complete, or Back to Course. You can also still access your account in the top right corner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Focus Mode is an exciting LearnDash feature that keeps your learners engaged in the coursework and not other tabs on their browser. Paired with the gamification of a progress bar, you should see higher engagement and completion rates with Focus mode enabled.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" width="695" height="390" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/n1t08GqMpV89NFDtOXb3_wLDMH3G2Ne9AqPVqJGFfkW1px4unU-VGtzyV3dEersX5vrZJeKPKawuW0k5QFVplc_1T6-CB0n8-yZNUzL5RMSRKYAkAWeXV8c9dQDSjZ16YjbrDI89J3eo9MSiSmaMiMcGRfaEsye7TUvB-4hocMfU4J_3zIYGbO8jjxDz.png"></p>



<h2 id="h-do-more-with-learndash">Do More with LearnDash</h2>



<p>Bitesize Bio has created a vibrant community of knowledge using LearnDash, and you can too! There are a variety of ways to utilize LearnDash on your website. You can use a free course paired with Focus Mode, just like Bitesize Bio has done to promote open knowledge sharing all while capturing emails and growing your audience. </p>



<p>How can LearnDash help you achieve your education goals for your students, company, or product?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re ready to find out, take LearnDash for a test drive in our <a href="http://demo.learndash.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a>. You can experience LearnDash from a learner&#8217;s or a course creator’s perspective in our free demo.

<p>The online course space is getting crowded. With so many options, it can be difficult for learners to decide where to pursue their learning.</p>



<p>When it comes to offering an online course, you’ll need to separate from the pack with some distinction. One way to differentiate yourself from the market is by getting <a href="https://www.learndash.com/why-you-should-get-your-online-course-accredited/">formal accreditation</a> in your industry. Another way to stand out is to offer a certificate of completion.</p>



<p>Certificates are a common way for people to demonstrate that they have completed training. And the truth is&nbsp; – <a href="https://www.learndash.com/worthless-certificates-are-profitable/">people like certificates!</a> The public acknowledgment of completion can be a huge driving factor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s explore the benefits of offering certificates for your courses and how to easily create and incorporate a certificate into your course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-benefits-of-offering-certification-for-your-course">The benefits of offering certification for your course</h2>



<p>Not only can a certificate offer you a competitive advantage, but you can also use it as an advertising factor. Lead with the fact that learners will receive official certification after completion to drive sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also an incentive to completing your course. Knowing there is tangible proof and verification of your completion can compel learners to finish. Pair a certificate with some <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-easy-ways-to-gamify-your-learndash-course/">gamification</a>, and you could see high engagement numbers as learners fly through your online course to earn their achievement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A certificate is also a piece of social proof of competence and credibility. Folks like collecting and showcasing certificates because it helps promote their skills. It can create faith and trust from employers who are looking to hire those certified skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, the social sharing of certificates works as free advertising for your course. When other folks see an official certificate, it’ll bolster their trust and drive their curiosity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to incorporate a certificate into your course? Here are a few tools to get you started.</p>



<h2 id="h-tools-for-creating-impressive-learning-certificates">Tools for Creating Impressive Learning Certificates</h2>

Plus, there are <a href="https://www.brusheezy.com/brushes/55066-free-certificate-and-seals-pack">free templates from marketplaces </a>to inspire ideas and speed up the process.</p>

<p>As you may know, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/update-release-learndash-4-0-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LearnDash 4.0</a> came with some exciting new features. One of these features is our first iteration of Learning Paths, also known as Challenge Exams.</p>



<p>We implemented learning paths to help your learners get the most out of your courses. With learning paths, learners have the option to take a test at the beginning of a course and move on to the next course if they pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The basic component of a learning path is a challenge exam. Let’s explore how to keep learners engaged by using challenge exams in your course.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-challenge-exam"><strong>What is a Challenge Exam?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>A challenge exam tests the existing skill and knowledge of a learner. It allows you to determine if a learner has the required knowledge to progress to a more advanced course.</p>



<p>You might be familiar with this concept if you’ve ever tested out of an entry-level college course. Or, if you’ve ever used <a href="https://www.learndash.com/duolingo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duolingo</a> to learn a new language, then you’ve seen challenge exams in action.</p>



<p>A challenge exam can speed up a learning path and help towards completion quicker. This can motivate and engage learners who want to move quickly and feel a sense of accomplishment.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-challenge-exams-are-used-in-learndash"><strong>How Challenge Exams Are Used In LearnDash</strong></h2>



<p>A LearnDash challenge exam works by giving a learner a test of your course prerequisites and completion requirements. They’ll take the one-time-only test where they must correctly answer every question to advance onto the next level course. If the quiz is not passed with a 100%, then the learner will have to continue and complete the entire course.</p>



<p>Challenge exams are positioned at the beginning of a course, taken before accessing the first unit. If a learner can pass a challenge exam,&nbsp; they’ll be issued a completion certificate (if applicable) and receive credit for completion. On the learner’s profile, each lesson, topic, or quiz that’s included in the course will also be marked as completed, as if they completed the entire course.</p>



<p>For the most part, challenge exams are created in LearnDash like regular quizzes. The only difference is that there isn&#8217;t a Gutenburg block that exists specifically for challenge exams outside of the challenge exam page.</p>



<h2 id="h-use-challenge-exams-to-create-a-learning-path"><strong>Use Challenge Exams to Create a Learning Path</strong></h2>



<p>A learning path is an important tool you can use to help learners achieve goals. For example, if you offer a sequence of cooking courses, learners from all skill levels can begin with the first course and test out if they’re more advanced. Instead of giving up out of boredom, learners get to move on to the content that’ll challenge and excite them. This can also help learners complete trainings faster and earn required certifications.</p>



<p>Here are two ways challenge exams help create your learning path:</p>



<h4 id="h-identify-your-learning-goals">Identify your learning goals</h4>



<p>You’ll be better able to determine the “basics” that a learner should know when you create a challenge exam. This&#8217;ll make the goals of your course, and subsequent courses, crystal clear.</p>



<h4 id="h-plan-the-sequence-of-courses">Plan the sequence of courses</h4>



<p>If a learner tests out of the first course, then they should be ready to be challenged in the next course. Creating a challenge exam forces you to think more carefully about what you include in your courses and what learners should know and expect from each course in the sequence.</p>



<h2 id="h-try-learning-paths-in-learndash"><strong>Try Learning Paths in LearnDash</strong></h2>



<p>Challenge exams offer the complete functionality you need to test your learner&#8217;s skills, find out what they know, and give them a personalized learning experience. Try using Challenge Exams in your next course to see how they encourage learners to advance to your more difficult courses.</p>

Absorbing new information is mentally taxing, even if the content is interesting. Classroom-based instructors have techniques to reengage a class when they sense they are losing their audience, but online education doesn’t receive the same benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, online learners typically face more distractions. Not only are they typically learning at home, where families and personal interests are vying for attention, but the entire rest of the internet is a browser tab away. Distractions often tend to snowball until the afternoon is gone before we know it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This experience can be exhausting and demoralizing. It can slow progress, impede retention, and may eventually cause learners to</span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-to-improve-online-course-completion-rates/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">quit the course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In particular, on-screen distractions can add to </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-understanding-cognitive-load-can-improve-your-course/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memory burden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, create confusion, and break concentration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there’s a way to help learners focus on what they need to know to mitigate all of the above problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus Mode Can Help</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash comes with a feature that is unique among industry LMSs: </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/guides/focus-mode/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus Mode.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Focus mode eliminates common webpage distractions and puts forth the most important content front and center to help learners progress through the course. Instructors can apply this setting from the back end of a course so that on certain pages or in certain lessons, unnecessary sidebars and navigation become hidden.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the features of Focus Mode and why they’ll help your learners:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Main navigation, sidebars, and footers are all removed from the screen.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, removing navigation is a dangerous move for usability purposes. Navigation typicallys helps users from feeling lost. But navigation menus, sidebars, and footers are also the primary culprits when it comes to cluttered and distracting layouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of Focus Mode is to help learners stay in place, not to offer them easy exit points. By clearing away navigation, we’re creating a dedicated study space for learners so they remain on the page until they complete the lesson.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Course navigation remains in place, but can be collapsed.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there is some necessary navigation that must remain. Focus Mode keeps the course navigation so learners can easily move through each lesson and still have access to the materials they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the course navigation becomes too distracting, learners can collapse the navigation to the side and expand it again later when they need to move to a different page.</span></p>
<h3><b>Focus Mode menu allows learners to return to the main course at any time.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in Focus Mode, learners should never feel trapped. Focus Mode can be exited at any time it’s not helping the learner succeed for some reason. This means that full site-wide choices are not removed, by merely only a click away.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learners can access the Focus Mode menu by hovering over their profile image. The menu items that appear can be customized to add as many items you feel will benefit your learners.</span></p>
<h3><b>CTA buttons are paired down to “Complete” and “Next Lesson.”</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An abundance of calls-to-action (CTAs) can be a terrible distraction. The purpose of a CTA is to try to convince a user to take </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">action</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They’re designed to be bold, enticing, and to get users to click away to somewhere else – which is what we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this, we’ve reduced the number of on-screen CTAs to just two: “Complete” and “Next Lesson.” This keeps the learner focused on moving forward through the course rather than leaving the lesson to go make a post in the community forum, read a blog, or watch a video.</span></p>
<h3><b>Progress bar remains in place.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far from being a distraction, the progress bar is a subtle motivation to learners, as well as a visual feedback mechanism that helps them know how far they have to go in the course. It’s a perfect feature to show prominently in Focus Mode.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lack</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a progress bar can be a distraction for many learners, because it makes them feel lost. Seeing that they’re making progress helps keep them on track and motivates them to hit the next mig milestone before ending the session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how all the activated features of Focus Mode will look for your learners: navigation, progress bar, simple CTAs, and an easy exit:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34183" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2022-11-23-at-10.26.04-AM-300x175.png" alt="focus mode" width="800" height="466"></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set Focus Mode in LearnDash</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In LearnDash settings, go to “General” and toggle on Focus Mode. From there, you can adjust the content width and sidebar position of Focus Mode. Click “Save” and test how your Focus Mode will look to learners on their end.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do More With LearnDash</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing visual clutter on the screen may seem like a small step, but it has a big impact on how learners feel when they are in your course. It puts the learner in the right frame of mind while they work through the course. Learners are not only less distracted, they also are feel less exhausted because they won’t have spent so much energy maintaining their concentration.</span></p>
