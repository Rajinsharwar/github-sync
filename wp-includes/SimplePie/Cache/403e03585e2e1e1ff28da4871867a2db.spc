The platform has over <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/youtube-stats">2.6 billion users worldwide</a>, and you can tap into this never-ending source of traffic to increase subscribers to your channel.</h1>



<p>As a course creator, more subscribers means more leads and a boost in the passive income generated through your elearning platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in order to be successful, you must have an effective strategy. With that in mind, here are the seven steps to start a YouTube channel to complement your online courses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-1-use-free-content-to-introduce-new-leads-to-your-brand">1. Use Free Content to Introduce New Leads to Your Brand</h2>



<p>Creating valuable free content is one of the best ways to stand out when promoting your online course on YouTube. You can offer videos and tutorials as a way to introduce new leads to your brand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you prove your value by uploading new content regularly, it simplifies the process of transforming your audience from free YouTube viewers to paying students.&nbsp; Viewers will be so impressed with your free material that they’ll start to wonder about the value they might get with your premium course.</p>



<p>A great way to use this marketing tactic is to <strong>publish free mini-courses</strong> on your channel. This helps familiarize students with your teaching style and build better relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, it’s a great way to sell naturally. At the end of your free course, you can invite learners to check out your premium course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to creating free content for your channel, you can also <strong>give away a premium lesson </strong>for free. This is probably the best way to prove to your audience that they will find real value in your course. Just make sure this is a lesson that can work well as a standalone video.</p>



<p>Publish the lesson on your channel and add the link to your homepage. If you have a newsletter, add the link there so subscribers can check out your course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-2-create-a-channel-trailer-to-attract-interest">2. Create a Channel Trailer to Attract Interest</h2>



<p>It’s smart to include some marketing in your video content, and a great way to do this is by creating a <a href="https://www.veedyou.com/9-tips-for-epic-youtube-channel-trailers/">YouTube channel trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trailer videos are great for grabbing your audience’s interest. You can use them to help prospective students imagine different ways they could change their life or business with your course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By showing them what’s possible, you make it a lot more likely that they will want to sign up for your course.</p>



<p>You can use a tool like Animaker’s all-in-one trailer maker to produce a gripping trailer for your channel.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UA6vqZBKXOtRVwFC7Fx_4T5iuDbsV28FvSZA3AwIlQYUFfjFpGRlbtOP3ydi4oMGWiBwh1fNn0EOAwJJu6VCRfqvq6CI-ZTRJoNa932G2upO0x8W2kd1ptnt60EyGuqdd2TW7ErQF09l5q-DMUsvDTU" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.animaker.com/trailer-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></p>



<p>Create a trailer video that points your audience toward your online course <em>or </em>lead magnet. Post this as your channel’s trailer. Since it has a prominent place on your home page, it will help you get more people to check out your course or lead magnet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your online course isn’t the only focus of your channel, then you can include it as an aside after your main video footage. </p>



<p>Either way, make sure you include a strong call to action (CTA) at the end of your video trailer. This is essential to get your viewers to take some kind of action, such as:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Purchasing your online course</li>



<li><a href="https://wpastra.com/blogging/how-to-build-an-email-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joining your email list</a></li>



<li>Becoming part of your online community</li>



<li>Subscribing to your YouTube channel</li>



<li>Connecting with you on other platforms</li>
</ul>



<p>…and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just remember to use one CTA at a time to avoid confusing your viewers. Though different, each CTA works effectively, and you must choose the one that’s relevant to your goals.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-3-incentivize-viewers-to-purchase-your-course">3. Incentivize Viewers to Purchase Your Course</h2>



<p>As the second-largest search engine in the world, YouTube is already attracting millions of viewers who are looking for the type of information you provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s up to you to give them a good enough reason why <em>your </em>online course may be the ideal solution to their problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can do this in a number of ways. Here are a few examples:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Create teasers:</strong> Create short videos with sneak peeks and helpful tips to incentivize viewers to purchase your online course or subscribe to a series. This type of content helps increase the buzz around your course and can generate more leads and sales.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Livestream R=regularly: </strong>Expert marketers will tell you that the best way to sell to anyone is through a live one-on-one conversation. The second-best way is a video call. It’s obvious why this is so true; talking to someone directly is a lot more powerful than posting on social media or sending an email through your <a href="https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-email-marketing-software-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email marketing platform</a>. </li>
</ul>



<p>Talk to your audience about their problems and answer their questions. Position your course as the ideal solution to help them achieve their goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Build a community:</strong> YouTube has a feature that makes it easy for creators to build a community around their topic. You can use non-video content here, such as stories and shorts, to engage your audience and reach even more people who are interested in your course. </li>
</ul>



<p>Don’t forget to add a compelling call to action to your videos. And make it easy for your viewers to take the next step toward purchasing your course or subscribing to a series, which gives you even more opportunities to convert viewers into customers (more on that below).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-4-get-subscribers-to-your-youtube-channel">4. Get Subscribers to Your YouTube Channel</h2>



<p>It’s tempting to want to include a link that goes directly to your online course sales page. But when dealing with your YouTube audience, it’s a lot easier to start small and offer them a lead magnet instead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although your end goal is to sell your course, make it your <em>immediate </em>goal to collect your viewers’ email addresses from your YouTube channel. This will allow you to stay connected to them so you can navigate them toward the ultimate goal of purchasing your online course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many businesses rely on email as a cost-effective way to acquire new customers and leads. With an average return on investment of <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$36 for each dollar spent</a> it’s not hard to see why. </p>



<p>To <a href="https://www.sender.net/blog/email-collection-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start collecting emails</a>, include a link to your lead magnet wherever you can. For instance, you can add a link to </p>



<ul>
<li>Your video description</li>



<li>End screen</li>



<li>Annotations&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cards, etc.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you have your lead magnet and updated links pointing to your opt-in page, you’ll be able to start collecting your viewers’ email addresses. After you complete the process, it’s worth using an <a href="https://www.voilanorbert.com/verify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email verification tool</a> to verify email addresses and keep your email list clean.</p>



<p>From there, you can start building and nurturing your relationship with customers via email and warm them up to purchasing your course.</p>



<p>Check out this example of how entrepreneur Elna Cain includes a link to her lead magnet (Free Business Plan) on her channel’s main header links.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Zdp8bueNnsEg02pSrq4zlIDdZyxzfq14hB28vRF47sjC9yyw1_0YZSBp_000bX_b1JJjzSTdvxraEJAHybpx3tl1LW9UkV7um3VYff7LsYdXZiMVq9FyU1AhX01NqoVYjGjhZk3vvL-wkuFCm5bxyOI" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElnaWrites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></p>



<p>She also includes it in her description below the published video. In fact, she makes sure to include links to her lead magnet wherever possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-5-cross-share-content-across-multiple-media-channels">5. Cross-Share Content Across Multiple Media Channels</h2>



<p>The videos you create for your YouTube channel can be cross-shared across social media channels and email newsletters to promote your new online course. You can also embed them into course landing pages or even start a blog that will complement your efforts. Plus, don’t neglect to repurpose YouTube videos as YouTube Shorts or native social media videos and turn them into new podcast episodes, blogs, and social media posts, and so on.</p>



<p>Just remember, although the goal is to make sales, it’s not a good idea to sell on every video. This won’t help you build a good relationship with your subscribers and fans across different platforms. Focus on creating content that educates and entertains. Tutorials, reviews, and customer stories are great options too. This builds a better connection with your followers and establishes trust.</p>



<p>You need to first show them that you have value to offer; then, they will trust you when you offer your premium course to help them solve their problems or achieve their goals. </p>



<p>So, when cross-sharing your content, make sure it’s a healthy mix of educational, personal, and promotional content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few tips on how you might incorporate utilized these content pillars into your marketing strategy: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Educational Content: </strong>Share helpful videos that educate your viewers for free. Don’t forget to include a call to action to like, subscribe, share, comment, or check out more videos on your channel. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Stories: </strong>You can share personal stories to help build deeper relationships with your audience. Showing your authentic self helps makes it easier to build credibility and trust. Include a CTA at the end of your video for viewers to join your email list or online community. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Promotional Videos:</strong> These are videos that you create specifically to promote your online courses, such as teasers and trailers. At the end of each, make sure to include a strong CTA to check out your premium course. </li>
</ul>



<p>You can increase your promotional activities on special days. For example, you can use coupons and <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-course-creators-can-take-advantage-of-black-friday-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discount offers on special occasions</a>, like Black Friday, Thanksgiving, etc. This will help you get even more eyeballs to your content. </p>



<h2 id="h-6-include-testimonial-videos-as-social-proof">6. Include Testimonial Videos as Social Proof</h2>



<p>Featuring testimonials in your videos can be pivotal in helping you sell your online course on your YouTube channel. According to recent stats, <a href="https://boast.io/20-statistics-about-using-testimonials-in-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">72% of customers</a> claim that positive testimonials and reviews enhance their trust in a brand. </p>



<p>Look for past clients or beta students who can leave positive reviews about their experience with going through your course. </p>



<p>Videographer Kevin Shen uses this tactic effectively to showcase positive testimonials from his past students.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dwKbwjghfPZeAqUJz7WdkNmQPeoXpL-3ES7INwNUnR45O3dyaYf0sB00RgDWRDVyODDJeiCw8WObYAc6LCA4F-x5gC--BwTSrqaJy8ZnCOk-28xXd-V2DHJ2IxCsm69Rw2yA2Ke6M9NmAASayMNKjhc" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzeWaXPghmjXZaC673XD4tA">Source</a></p>



<p>These types of reviews from authentic customers can work wonders in helping you build authority and <a href="https://startup.unitelvoice.com/build-brand-trust">trust in your brand</a>. They also play a huge role in influencing customers’ purchasing decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure your testimonials provide answers to questions from your target students.</p>



<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>What made you choose this online course over others?&nbsp;</li>



<li>What was the main problem you had that made you want to start this course?&nbsp;</li>



<li>How has the course impacted your life/business?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Include real stories told by happy and satisfied clients to help you build trust with your YouTube audience <em>and </em>show potential clients that you can deliver results.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-use-youtube-ads-as-an-independent-revenue-channel">7. Use YouTube Ads as an Independent Revenue Channel&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are many ways to monetize your YouTube channel and make money from your creative work. YouTube ads are among the most common channel monetization methods.</p>



<p>You can turn your YouTube channel into an independent revenue source once your traffic reaches a certain threshold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can get access to YouTube’s monetization features once your channel meets the following requirements:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>More than 4,000 valid public watch hours in the past 12 months</li>



<li>More than 1,000 subscribers to your channel</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you hit those thresholds, you’ll be able to sign up for YouTube’s partner program and monetize your channel. This is an easy way to add an extra passive income stream to your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the best part? Once you become a YouTube Partner, many other earning opportunities open up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to video ads, you also get access to YouTube Premium subscription fees, channel memberships, Super Chat, and other features that give you a direct line to your fans’ wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-bonus-tip-leverage-youtube-seo">Bonus Tip: Leverage YouTube SEO</h2>



<p>When creating free content to promote your course on your YouTube channel, make sure to optimize each video for SEO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>YouTube is the second largest search engine, and it offers creators a reliable way to grow organically—but only if you leverage YouTube SEO. You must use this to your advantage to get as many people to see your content as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the things you can do to optimize your content for SEO include the following:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Video title:</strong> Come up with a relevant title that your ideal students would naturally search.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Video description:</strong> Write a concise description that gives a clear overview of your video. Include any keywords your audience might search to discover related content.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Video tags: </strong>Add as many related tags as you can. This will further enhance the chances of each video showing up in search.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Thumbnail image:</strong> Great video thumbnails entice people to click through to watch your video. Make sure each video you upload has a relevant thumbnail that will make your viewers excited to click on it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this guide has helped you understand how you can use your YouTube channel to complement your online course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Executed effectively, a YouTube strategy can help you connect with a wider audience, generate a constant flow of leads, and make more sales.</p>

<p>When people hear the term “artificial intelligence” they tend to think of rogue robots, anarchic androids or sinister cyborgs taking over the world and giving humanity the same short shrift that the asteroid gave to the dinosaurs all of those years ago. While, we admit, an AI-induced apocalypse might—but probably won’t—one day come to pass, the AI that we have today is here to help.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’ll show you how to use OpenAI and ChatGPT models with LearnDash so you can harness the power of AI for your e-learning platform. Automatically draft lessons, create course outlines, and even answer students’ questions with the help of AI and automation tools such as Uncanny Automator.</p>



<p>Join the robot revolution in e-learning—and save yourself countless hours and thousands of dollars in the process!</p>



<h2 id="h-introduction-to-openai-and-chatgpt"><strong>Introduction to OpenAI and ChatGPT</strong></h2>



<p>OpenAI is the artificial intelligence research laboratory behind the popular chatbot, ChatGPT. Built on OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) model, ChatGPT is the very latest in natural language processing (NLP) technology.</p>



<p>With a beta version that launched in 2020, the AI uses statistical modeling and deep learning to create human-like text. That’s basically just the high-tech way of saying that ChatGPT read a lot (and we mean A LOT) of content across the internet to learn how people write on various topics so that it could do the same.</p>

<p>Since ChatGPT’s official launch in November 2022, the internet has had fun prompting it to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/chatgpt-ai-text-university-waterloo-maura-grossman-1.6703819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make poems</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://maximumeffort.substack.com/p/i-taught-chatgpt-to-invent-a-language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create languages</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/i-asked-chatgpt-ai-to-write-a-harry-potter-fan-fiction-the-result-will-blow-your-mind-2d4f25cc705d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compose fan fiction</a>—but the advanced AI can do so much more.</p>



<p>You’ll need to&nbsp;<a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create an account</a>&nbsp;with OpenAI to power your e-learning platform with artificial intelligence. To create an account, all you need is an email and a password—and the ability to take a single-question Turing test to prove that you are not, yourself, a robot.</p>



<h2 id="h-introduction-to-learndash"><strong>Introduction to LearnDash</strong></h2>



<p>LearnDash is the #1 learning management system (LMS) for WordPress. Whether you’re running an after school program or managing training and compliance for a multinational corporation, LearnDash has all of the features you need to create a functional (and futuristic) digital classroom.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-2.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash LearnDash Homepage" class="wp-image-125284"/></figure></div>


<p>With LearnDash, you can easily build your e-learning platform from the ground up—from granular lessons and quizzes, up to modules and even course groups that define entire curricula. And don’t forget to keep your students motivated with certificates for completion or outstanding grades.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already,&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/share/learndash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>&nbsp;to get the LearnDash plugin and join the future of e-learning!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-benefits-of-automation-and-ai-in-e-learning"><strong>The Benefits of Automation and AI in E-learning</strong></h2>



<p>Pairing your LearnDash LMS with OpenAI comes with several benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Save Time:</strong>&nbsp;OpenAI churns out large amounts of text faster than a caffeinated cartoon typist. Cut back on the time it takes you to create course content, leaving you more time to interact with your students.</li>



<li><strong>Save Money:</strong>&nbsp;Cut back on your content creation costs with OpenAI by reducing the amount of time it takes to generate quality content.</li>



<li><strong>Stay on Brand:</strong>&nbsp;Once you find the right configurations and prompts for your OpenAI model, you’ll be able to rapidly produce content that is consistent and on-brand.</li>
</ul>



<p>Developers and educators are constantly finding new ways to apply AI to e-learning. But here are just some of the ways that you can start using AI in your LearnDash LMS today:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Create Course Outlines:</strong>&nbsp;Standardize your course creation process and help educators save time with auto-generated course outlines.</li>



<li><strong>Draft Lessons:</strong>&nbsp;Use simple forms or other input methods to automate the process of drafting new lessons.</li>



<li><strong>Tutor and Support:</strong>&nbsp;Once you get the hang of OpenAI, you can create chatbots to help tutor your students and support them through the learning process.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the following sections, we’re going to actually walk through the steps of connecting LearnDash to OpenAI. You’ll need at least the Pro version of&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/pricing/">Uncanny Automator</a>&nbsp;to follow along, however Automator offers a 14-day money back guarantee so trying out premium features comes at no-risk to you.</p>



<p>After you’ve downloaded Automator Pro,&nbsp;<a href="https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/open-ai/">read this guide</a>&nbsp;on connecting it with your new OpenAI account or find the abridged version below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Under your account tab in your OpenAI account page, click on&nbsp;<strong>View API keys</strong>. In the&nbsp;<em>API Keys</em>&nbsp;screen, click&nbsp;<strong>Create new secret key</strong>&nbsp;and copy the new key.</li>



<li>From your WordPress Admin Sidebar, navigate to&nbsp;<em>Automator</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Settings</em>. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Premium integrations</strong>&nbsp;tab and scroll down to&nbsp;<strong>OpenAI</strong>.</li>



<li>Paste the key from your OpenAI account into the field labeled&nbsp;<em>Secret key</em>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Connect OpenAI account</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Now you’re ready to power your LearnDash LMS with OpenAI!</p>



<h2 id="h-build-an-ai-generated-course-outline"><strong>Build an AI-Generated Course Outline</strong></h2>



<p>OpenAI is, perhaps unsurprisingly, great at understanding structure—it is, after all, a computer. That makes it the perfect teacher’s assistant when it comes to creating course outlines. Here’s how it’s done.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-1-create-a-new-recipe"><strong>Step 1: Create a New Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>From your WordPress Admin Sidebar, navigate to&nbsp;<em>Automator</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Add New</em>. In the pop-up window that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Logged-in users</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/How-to-Automate-Your-Customer-Onboarding-Process-25-%E2%80%94-Recipe-type-selector-Logged-in-users.png" alt="Automator Recipe type selector Logged-in users" class="wp-image-120181"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-2-name-your-recipe"><strong>Step 2: Name Your Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>We’ve named this recipe&nbsp;<em>OpenAI LearnDash Course Outline</em>&nbsp;but we recommend coming up with whatever naming convention suits your workflows best.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-3-configure-your-trigger-s"><strong>Step 3: Configure Your Trigger(s)</strong></h3>



<p>The trigger is the event that will set your recipe into motion. For our workflows, we’ve created a WPForms form to pass information to OpenAI. Based on the OpenAI inputs (that we’ll discuss later), a basic form can look something like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-4.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash WPForms" class="wp-image-125285"/></figure></div>


<p>A form-based trigger can be useful to restrict direct access to OpenAI while still allowing multiple users to take advantage of it.</p>



<p>To use a form-based trigger, in the&nbsp;<em>Triggers</em>&nbsp;panel, from the menu of available integrations, click&nbsp;<strong>WPForms</strong>&nbsp;or your preferred form-building plugin.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-5.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator WPForms Integration" class="wp-image-125286"/></figure></div>


<p>From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>A user submits a form</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-6.png" alt="Automator WPForms Action A user submits a form" class="wp-image-125287"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator will prompt you to select a form. After you’ve selected your course outline creator form, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. Your trigger should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-7.png" alt="Automator WPForms Action A user submits a form Live" class="wp-image-125288"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-4-configure-your-primary-action"><strong>Step 4: Configure Your Primary Action</strong></h3>



<p>In the Actions panel, click&nbsp;<strong>Add action</strong>. From the menu of available integrations, select&nbsp;<strong>OpenAI</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-8.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI Integration" class="wp-image-125289"/></figure></div>


<p>From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Use a prompt to generate text with the Davinci model</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-9.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Action Use prompt to generate text with the Davinci Model" class="wp-image-125290"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator will present you with an editor where you can configure the information that it will pass along to OpenAI.</p>



<p><em>Temperature</em>&nbsp;defines how “creative” you want OpenAI to be in its response with lower values indicating less creativity and higher values indicating more creativity.</p>



<p><em>Maximum length</em>&nbsp;refers to the number of tokens that OpenAI has, with 100 OpenAI tokens roughly correlating to 75 English language words. For a comprehensive breakdown of OpenAI tokens,&nbsp;<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.</p>



<p>Not to be confused with OpenAI’s tokens, Automator has its own&nbsp;<em>tokens</em>&nbsp;(i.e., dynamic pieces of data pulled from your website and even from within recipes).</p>



<p>In our example, we’re allowing users to pass along both&nbsp;<em>temperature</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>maximum length</em>&nbsp;information to OpenAI by using Automator tokens that pull data from the WPForms trigger. To use Automator tokens, click on the&nbsp;<strong>Asterisk</strong>&nbsp;and select a token from the drop-down list.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-10.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Tokens" class="wp-image-125291"/></figure></div>


<p>Note: In practice,&nbsp;<em>temperature</em>&nbsp;is correlated to your brand’s voice and OpenAI calculates cost based on the number of tokens you use. As such, you may not want to permit all users to change those settings and opt, instead, to use static values in those fields.</p>



<p>Using all Automator tokens, we’ve filled in the remaining fields as such:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-11.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Action Tokens" class="wp-image-125292"/></figure></div>


<p>Once you’ve filled in the fields in the way that best suits your workflows, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. Your action should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-12.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Action Use prompt to generate text with the Davinci Model Live" class="wp-image-125293"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-5-configure-your-secondary-action"><strong>Step 5: Configure Your Secondary Action</strong></h3>



<p>The first action that we’ve created will get OpenAI to generate our course outline. This secondary action will get that course outline created in LearnDash.</p>



<p>In the&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel, click&nbsp;<strong>Add action</strong>. From the menu of available integrations, select&nbsp;<strong>WordPress</strong>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-13.png" alt="Automator WordPress Integration" class="wp-image-125294"/></figure></div>


<p>From the drop-down list that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Create a post</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-14.png" alt="Automator WordPress Action Create a post" class="wp-image-125295"/></figure></div>


<p>Automator will present you with an editor, similar to the one from the first OpenAI action. In the field labeled&nbsp;<em>Type</em>, select&nbsp;<em>Course</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-15.png" alt="Automator WordPress Action Create a post Type Course" class="wp-image-125296"/></figure></div>


<p>In the field labeled&nbsp;<em>Content</em>&nbsp;is where we’re going to include the output from OpenAI. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Asterisk</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Use a prompt to generate text with the Davinci model</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Response</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-16.png" alt="Automator OpenAI Tokens Response" class="wp-image-125297"/></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, in the&nbsp;<em>Title</em>&nbsp;field, use the&nbsp;<em>Course Title</em>&nbsp;token from the WPForms trigger to automatically generate your course title.</p>



<p>Once you’re finished, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. Your&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel should now look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-17.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI and LearnDash Actions" class="wp-image-125298"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-6-it-s-alive-it-s-alive"><strong>Step 6: It’s Alive! It’s Alive!</strong></h3>



<p>The last thing for you to do is to toggle the recipe from&nbsp;<em>Draft</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Live</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-21.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI LearnDash Course Outline Recipe" class="wp-image-125299"/></figure></div>


<p>Just for fun, here’s the course outline that OpenAI returned from the information that we put in our form:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-22.png" alt="OpenAI Sample Writing Introduction to Supercomputers" class="wp-image-125300"/></figure></div>


<p>…maybe the AI is sentient after all.</p>



<p>Note: OpenAI is fast—but not necessarily instantaneous. It can take a few seconds to return content, so if you don’t see a new post right after it runs, wait approximately 30 seconds. The time it will take also depends on the model you choose (Davinci is slowest) and the number of tokens you allow (more tokens means more time). If the action times out, consider changing the model or reducing the number of tokens.</p>



<h2 id="h-build-an-ai-generated-lesson"><strong>Build an AI-Generated Lesson</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we have our outline, it’s time to generate the lessons that will make up the bulk of our course content. And if anyone knows anything about supercomputers, it’s probably OpenAI—<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-builds-a-supercomputer-for-openai-for-training-massive-ai-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s built on one</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-1-create-a-new-recipe-1"><strong>Step 1: Create a New Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>From your WordPress Admin Sidebar, navigate to&nbsp;<em>Automator</em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em>Add New</em>. In the pop-up window that appears, select&nbsp;<em>Logged-in users</em>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-2-name-your-recipe-1"><strong>Step 2: Name Your Recipe</strong></h3>



<p>We’ve named this recipe&nbsp;<em>OpenAI Lesson Generator</em>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-3-configure-your-trigger"><strong>Step 3: Configure Your Trigger</strong></h3>



<p>We’ll be using the same form submission trigger with a different form for this recipe as we did with the last one, albeit with a much higher temperature.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-23.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash WPForms Lesson" class="wp-image-125301"/></figure></div>


<p>In the&nbsp;<em>Triggers</em>&nbsp;panel of the recipe builder, from the menu of available integrations, click&nbsp;<strong>WPForms</strong>&nbsp;or your preferred form-building plugin</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-24.gif" alt="Automator WPForms Trigger A user submits a form" class="wp-image-125302"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-4-configure-your-primary-action-1"><strong>Step 4: Configure Your Primary Action</strong></h3>



<p>We’ll be using the same primary action for this recipe as we did in the previous one with slightly different configurations for OpenAI.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-25.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash OpenAI Prompt Editor" class="wp-image-125303"/></figure></div>


<p>Once you’re finished, click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-5-configure-your-secondary-action-1"><strong>Step 5: Configure Your Secondary Action</strong></h3>



<p>This secondary action is also very similar to the secondary action from the first recipe, with the only difference being that we’re creating a lesson instead of a course.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-26.png" alt="Automator WordPress Action Create a post Type Lesson" class="wp-image-125304"/></figure></div>


<p>Your&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;panel should look something like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-27.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI and LearnDash Actions Lesson" class="wp-image-125305"/></figure></div>


<h3 id="h-step-6-go-live"><strong>Step 6: Go Live</strong></h3>



<p>Toggle your recipe from&nbsp;<em>Draft</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Live</em>. It should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-28.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash Automator OpenAI LearnDash Lesson Draft Recipe" class="wp-image-125306"/></figure></div>


<p>Here’s a snippet of the lesson that OpenAI returned:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-29.png" alt="OpenAI Sample Writing on Introduction to Supercomputers" class="wp-image-125308"/></figure></div>


<h2 id="h-generate-unique-featured-images-for-your-new-content"><strong>Generate Unique Featured Images for Your New Content</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve ever wondered what artificial intelligence does in its spare time, wonder no longer: it creates beautiful works of art.</p>



<p>With OpenAI’s image-generator, DALL-E 2, you can create original images that suit your needs—no matter how outlandish they are. Even if you asked DALL-E 2 to generate totally random images of, say, “a kangaroo dressed as a French artist sitting at an easel in the desert at dusk, digital art”.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-101.png" alt="DALL-E 2 images of a kangaroo painting in a desert" class="wp-image-127258"/></figure></div>


<p>Now that you see what DALL-E 2 can do and you’ve created some new course and lesson content, it’s time to add original featured images using Automator’s OpenAI integration.</p>



<p>We modified our original WPForms form to include an image prompt field.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-102.png" alt="Using OpenAI and ChatGPT Models with LearnDash WPForms course and image prompt form" class="wp-image-127260"/></figure></div>


<p>Next, in our&nbsp;<em>OpenAI LearnDash Course Outline</em>&nbsp;recipe, we’ll add the action to generate an image using the prompt from our updated form.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-103.gif" alt="Automator OpenAI integration to generate an image" class="wp-image-127261"/></figure></div>


<p>In our WordPress action to create a post, we simply add the image URL token from our OpenAI action into the&nbsp;<em>Featured image URL</em>&nbsp;field.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://automatorplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Using-OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Models-with-LearnDash-104.png" alt="Automator OpenAI integration image url tokens" class="wp-image-127264"/></figure></div>


<p>Note: Actions in Automator occur sequentially as they appear on screen. If the OpenAI action to generate an image appears after the WordPress action to create a post, then the image url tokens will not appear in the WordPress action. To correct this, simply drag the OpenAI action above the WordPress action and the image url tokens will appear.</p>



<p>With the action to generate an image, your new recipe should look like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Our new course outline now includes some amazing, AI-generated artwork.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Automator also saved us the trouble of downloading the image ourselves and uploaded it directly into our WordPress media library.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 id="h-build-an-ai-powered-chatbot-for-students"><strong>Build an AI-Powered Chatbot for Students</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we have AI-generated course content, why not extend the power of AI to&nbsp; support your students with a chatbot?</p>

<p>Now, with this recipe, every time a student asks a question on your site, Automator will route the question to OpenAI and the student will get an immediate AI-generated answer. For questions about learning content, students can get an immediate—and hopefully helpful—answer instead of waiting for an instructor. It’s like they’ll have their own (virtual) teacher’s assistant!</p>



<p>In the (not-so-distant) future, you’ll be able to train OpenAI on your specific documentation and content so that it can even provide more detailed course and site feedback. Imagine a more dynamic AI that can provide context-sensitive answers, based on your own content!</p>



<p>We’re not quite there yet, but it’s coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-future-of-ai-in-e-learning"><strong>The Future of AI in E-learning</strong></h2>



<p>With AI that is this user-friendly, the android apocalypse is a long way off. And, as powerful as OpenAI is, it’s just the beginning of AI in e-learning. With exciting new tools such as&nbsp;<a href="https://nolej.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nolej AI</a>&nbsp;on the horizon, you’ll be able to create interactive learning experiences within your LearnDash LMS at the push of a button.</p>

<p>If you create online courses, you’ve likely heard of instructional design. <a href="https://www.learndash.com/3-instructional-design-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instructional design</a> is the theory and rationale behind how we create courses. It provides a framework for how to design a course to match the way people tend to learn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instructional design is a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/category/instructional-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large field</a>, and there’s a lot to learn. Along the way, you may feel as though you’ll never be ready to launch because your course will never meet all of the standards.</p>



<p>But it’s not about meeting every single standard. In fact, you mainly need to avoid these four instructional design pitfalls:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Lack of clear objectives</li>



<li>Not considering the audience&nbsp;</li>



<li>Overloading content</li>



<li>Neglecting evaluation and feedback&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>If you focus on these four pillars and avoid falling into their trap, you should feel fully confident in your course design.&nbsp; Let’s dive into each of these four areas below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-1-lack-of-clear-learning-objectives">Mistake #1: Lack of Clear Learning Objectives</h2>



<p>A learning objective is the outcome that you want your learners to achieve by the end of your course. Think of a learning objective as one new niche skill or secret to success in your industry that the learner can take with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, the smaller the promise, the better. It will lead to higher learner satisfaction, as it’s more likely that most learners will hit that goal. However, you don’t want to be too specific up front, as it can intimidate learners who may feel they’ll never be able to achieve the goal you’re promising. Instead, aim to create a balanced, true assessment.</p>



<p>Remember: course objectives are achieved by the <em>end</em> of your course, so don’t feel pressured to start covering every topic in unit one. However, each unit should be designed to lead to overall course outcome.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-2-not-considering-the-audience">Mistake #2: Not Considering the Audience</h2>



<p>If you don’t know exactly who your course is for, it’ll feel unfocused and unhelpful. First, ask yourself who your ideal student is. The more clearly you can identify this persona, the easier it is to target their specific needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Find your ideal student by analyzing your audience. Create surveys or ask for feedback on social media. Collect and analyze your responses to determine your average learner. Keep this person in mind as you design your course. It will feel as if it’s written for them, and they’ll be delighted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not knowing your audience will lead to ineffective design. Your lessons will feel too general or try to cover too much at once. Avoid the temptation of having mass appeal. Instead, design for a niche to build authority, gain trust, and increase the perceived value of your course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-3-overloading-on-content">Mistake #3: Overloading on Content</h2>



<p>information overload often happens when instructors get carried away with their material. A lesson with too much content will look overwhelming and deter your learners from ever getting started. You’ll need to thoughtfully “chunk,” or break up, your lesson content in a digestible way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure to structure each lesson around one key point. Start small and then slowly increase more difficult and complicated topics or scenarios. Consider <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-micro-learning-in-your-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro content</a> that can be completed in a matter of minutes, like small activities or quizzes released daily. This helps learners build a pattern of checking in and refreshing their knowledge.</p>



<p>In addition, find ways to introduce different lesson formats. Maybe you have three or four lessons in your usual format, and then have the fifth lesson be a more involved scenario-based design. Alternate the conclusion between a video quiz and a class-based assignment. Either way,&nbsp; mix up your content so that the lessons don’t blend together and start to feel overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-mistake-4-neglecting-evaluation-and-feedback">Mistake #4: Neglecting Evaluation and Feedback</h2>



<p>Neglecting to gather feedback and course evaluations will do nothing to help your course. It’s important to know how learners perceive your information. After all, what seems simple and easy for you may not to them, so try to understand from their point of view as much as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To gather feedback, consider using exit surveys or satisfaction polls. Use can use guided questions and ranking scales. Also consider offering a final reflection essay question at the end of your course. This’ll help both you and your learners assess and understand their progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember that feedback is an <a href="https://www.learndash.com/responding-positively-negative-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity for improvement.</a> If you’re hearing that the lessons are too long, break them up. When learners are struggling to pass quizzes, offer shorter, more frequent review quizzes. Or, if learners are dropping out at the same point in your course, check in with them personally and see what support they need to finish.</p>



<p>And if you are getting great feedback, listen to what your learners love and double down.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-work-smarter-with-instructional-design">Work Smarter with Instructional Design&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It’s unlikely your course will ever feel fully finished, but that doesn’t mean it’s not ready. In fact, the more you hold back launching your course, the longer it will take to gather the feedback you need to make it better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you recognize some of these errors in a course you’ve already launched, there’s nothing stopping you from making updates. And if you’re confident your course isn’t committing any of these four major instructional design mistakes, then it’s time to put it in front of learners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using LearnDash to add courses and lessons to your WordPress site, then you know that organizing and displaying learning resources is essential. Most courses need extra resources to boost students’ learning, such as course handbook or other downloadable materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s easy enough to manually list a few links within a course or lesson. However, this becomes unmanageable if you need to display larger numbers of resources. Students might need a quicker way to find specific items.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thankfully, there is a solution with the <a href="https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Document Library Pro</a> plugin. This tool allows you to create a searchable database of learning resources that can be easily accessed by your students from within a LearnDash course or lesson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combining the plugin with LearnDash helps you to:</p>



<ul><li>Enhance the user experience by providing a centralized location for all course resources.</li><li>Increase the ability to search and filter materials, making it easier for students to find what they need.</li><li>Add resource version control to your existing <a href="https://www.learndash.com/8-metrics-every-course-creator-should-track/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tracking and reporting capabilities</a>, allowing instructors to know which learning materials were available when.</li></ul>



<p>We&#8217;ll show you how to use the Document Library Pro plugin to add LearnDash course materials to a searchable database within a course or lesson.</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-left" id="h-best-wordpress-plugin-for-adding-learndash-course-materials">Best WordPress Plugin for Adding LearnDash Course Materials</h3>



<p>As well as adding LearnDash course materials library to your site, Document Library Pro allows you to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Display LearnDash course materials anywhere on your site. </strong>Use the default plugin shortcodes to display your resources on the main course page, the &#8216;Materials&#8217; tab, the course sidebar, or even within individual lessons.</li><li><strong>Display the resources in a table or grid.</strong> The table layout is recommended for large numbers of resources, while the grid view is ideal for smaller collections of materials.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Offer advanced search, filtering, and sorting features. </strong>Your students can now use an optional search box to locate specific learning materials faster. They also get powerful sorting and filtering functionality.</li><li><strong>File downloads and third-party website links. </strong>You can embed all sorts of downloadable files including PDFs, audio, and video files. Students can also follow links to third-party websites for further learning.</li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="602" height="471" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/aVST_nhr9NIGqtJn-TJaCkvTh44UTB7w-rwcmdl-rs7EEmQK0aXsqSqAZKYZVI4Y0p4_ED2aKFXvMVm784VjYFDUUZHa9ITYDeOXQ86D4AsbIehiQBq4Em0fPm2sbJoaFQNXK8m2MO_8-jo8DwsJlMBfR2r6eMmUzgIdaD8n2dB3gEKqUIxT838.jpeg"></p>



<p>To add these powerful features to your LearnDash courses, follow the steps below.</p>



<h4 id="h-step-1-install-and-activate-document-library-pro">Step 1: Install and Activate Document Library Pro</h4>



<p>To enable search in your <a href="https://barn2.com/learndash-resource-library-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LearnDash course materials library</a>, you need to install and activate the plugin. <a href="https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Get your copy of Document Library Pro</a> to receive a downloadable ZIP file link and license key in your email.</p>



<p>In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload Plugin</strong>. Select the plugin ZIP file and click <strong>Install Now</strong> followed by <strong>Activate Plugin</strong>. Follow the setup wizard’s instructions and enter your license key and default settings for your course materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pay attention to the <strong>Columns </strong>and <strong>Document filters </strong>options. The Columns option controls what information to display about each course material or resource. For example, you might want to show its title, a brief excerpt, the categories, and a link to download (or to view on a third party site, depending on the type of course material).&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also enable searching and filtering if you want your site users to search LearnDash course materials. This allows you to go beyond listing a few course materials in a specific site location.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/XfWLn3ktBSH2M2izQEGucg0NVtnUs1EUoXbfDNKn1qoCeB9XQKLWQ193naNhKf8rYxEamxXtjfY5L8ba8ENPJYiJQSWbg-bajpyYXxBJdBFfRUucS_HalFOG5r6dmFqlUDn_pzEvpyrJSB0ky_TtE7TTlVKYHtc8unFjcdzt4XZf-mSYO4QqNH8.png" width="602" height="401"></p>



<p>You can also begin tweaking more features:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Customize the style of download links.</li><li>Enable instant previews, so that people can access course materials without having to download them.</li><li>Add advanced sorting and filtering options.</li><li>Control the elements above and below the table or grid.</li><li>Customize mobile visibility and responsive options.</li></ul>



<h4 id="h-step-2-add-learndash-course-materials-to-your-site">Step 2: Add LearnDash Course Materials to Your Site</h4>



<p>You can add LearnDash course materials to WordPress in bulk, or one by one. To add course materials to LearnDash individually, go to <strong>Documents &gt; Add New</strong>. This works like adding a new WordPress post.</p>



<p>Add the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/why-think-about-course-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">course material’s title</a> and description. In the <strong>Document Link </strong>tab, you can either upload a file directly to the WordPress Media Library or add a third-party URL link.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/L6UfYBGvonSYc-IpX4b7TY9UNOs1qj4NAL-hC6uCgYCpZy9UGt0QlDTQ8mCs9EDww4KaR3Qfqs-w5QpUD_REGyytkn1BZyNcxiObOb_KEUZJGDraaPlKaJ0zu40-_G-EyA-zPKpuuldrJi5CH9pdIgcY9DAwuUC5Oh-u1XbynvrlI_vGPDLouho.png" width="602" height="369"></p>



<p>To add LearnDash course materials in bulk, navigate to <strong>Documents &gt; Import</strong>. Here you can either drag and drop multiple document files into the upload area or do a bulk CSV file upload.</p>



<p>Once you’ve added LearnDash course materials to your site, let’s display them in the appropriate courses and lessons.</p>



<h4 id="h-step-3-add-learndash-course-materials-using-a-shortcode">Step 3: Add LearnDash Course Materials Using a Shortcode</h4>



<p>With Document Library Pro, you use a shortcode to list your newly added LearnDash course materials. The plugin offers <a href="https://barn2.com/kb/document-library-options/?utm_source=barn2&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=text&amp;utm_content=learndash-resource-library-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 50 shortcode options</a>. You also get to decide what they should look like.</p>



<p>The basic plugin shortcode for listing LearnDash course materials is [doc_library]. This will list all the course materials on your site, with the settings that you selected in the setup wizard.</p>



<p>If you have more than one course, or if you want to list different course materials in other lessons, then you need to tell the shortcode which materials to display. To add LearnDash course materials this way, you can use shortcodes like:</p>



<ul><li>[doc_library doc_category=&#8221;wordpress&#8221;] &#8211; This will list only course materials in the “WordPress” category.</li><li>[doc_library doc_tag=&#8221;woocommerce,bogo&#8221;] &#8211; This displays all the resources tagged &#8220;woocommerce” and “bogo&#8221;.</li></ul>



<p>Once you’ve planned out your shortcodes, you can start adding them to your courses. Let’s walk you through some of the most popular options.</p>



<h4 id="h-adding-a-searchable-resource-library-to-the-main-learndash-course-page">Adding a Searchable Resource Library to the Main LearnDash Course Page</h4>



<p>Since you’re adding additional materials to individual courses, it makes sense to display them directly on the course’s homepage. This creates a central resource library for the entier LearnDash course. The most popular position for this would be below the course overview section.</p>



<p>To do this, go to <strong>LearnDash LMS &gt; Courses </strong>and hover over the course you want to add materials to. Then click <strong>Edit</strong>. On the &#8216;Edit Course&#8217; screen, scroll down to the main description and add a shortcode block.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="602" height="272" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/BssnrLVQFoJ0xuqnp79qsXpF3fFkczxUoQjt0kZsFCGIR2kvJnNVTRRZtKcc40QH9dX3FUpExFCd_gKK1f-Cj2xKFYRXwhmtA_jK9Kne0GBgvfuFxDD7ovXjQ2HpCOxy2dKoUdAhBgnjUcPi9PDA9rNg3qr_2QHqfcXmn4UQLGEoRvvQ8dKuUJI.png"></p>



<p>Then paste the Document Library Pro shortcode where you want to display the course resource library. Click <strong>Preview </strong>to check out the results in a new tab. Your first LearnDash course materials library should look something like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="504" height="495" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Alm5PaYzhqcrCiVHw1DSW9wQk8uG2EBOAslvlopMWOJ-E_36WfDaYLl9kcD85DzEU9YULKyjOhuLNyzO4yv1dnL9LPGotWJhHateUzxLqDZ9w2nXPv6ti71I63OQyUe2UeoeSET1dopMGg2Xrv9LnOU5CU21MOiUXQwCfjGEDcYvle-y_N2rcSg.png"></p>



<h4 id="h-add-learndash-course-materials-to-the-materials-tab">Add LearnDash Course Materials to the Materials Tab</h4>



<p>Another option is to display your LearnDash course materials library in the ‘Course Materials’ tab. The LearnDash &#8216;Course Materials&#8217; tab could be an ideal location to display all the materials for a particular course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To add the materials here, navigate to the <strong>Settings </strong>tab of the ‘Edit Course’ page. Scroll down to the <strong>Display and Content Options </strong>section. Toggle on <strong>Course Materials</strong> and enter the Document Library Pro shortcode.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/jn-tX0_jYAqQPS3W-BJ4Q_F06sCqqbNXxekfKPVFDOYKxhMEdCD4HzBaTOwY0y5tCW1xsiSBmJMZVtqjNIeB7VOcVRMpICQSRlImFU0uviB7PDnoX0Lzt92pRd4a11oXBxisBhUsqKaGWrCp9FhluLONUGF2XDxMdvyfCSvvLFVg03eKNqQQvFs.png" width="602" height="341"></p>



<p>Now, the course materials tab will have a resource library that looks like this.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" width="520" height="482" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/lzjHHSf8eT8pvjtqERMPRXJlxCeLnMkqUl0qgs961oo8tmJ5O8OQs9gDtrZWZzhPsbhHozuv5TPowyY4r6tXT0C6aMmUQ4R1xbDlRhKFPIKR5mbdv4sQrxXEW_bY_bkwRB-liAuCJA44_pUBawmmGsbkCGVJwRxY_NEhY3aiqPOLvboFK65x2qg.png"></p>



<h4 id="h-add-learndash-course-materials-to-the-course-sidebar">Add LearnDash Course Materials to the Course Sidebar</h4>



<p>Alternatively, you can make your LearnDash course materials even more accessible by displaying them in the course sidebar. The good thing about adding LearnDash course materials to the course sidebar is that they will be visible on all the course and lesson pages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this, simply go to <strong>Appearance &gt; Widgets</strong> and add a shortcode block to the sidebar widget. If you want to apply the sidebar display to only specific course pages, you can use a free plugin like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Widget Options</a>. It allows you to choose which courses and lessons to display the widgets on.</p>

<h4 id="h-add-learndash-course-materials-to-individual-lessons">Add LearnDash Course Materials to Individual Lessons</h4>



<p>There are also common use cases for adding course materials to individual Learndash lessons. This can be useful if each lesson has unique additional resources like audio tracks and lesson notes. You can easily showcase these materials at the end of any lesson or even include a ‘Further Resources’ lesson at the end of the course.</p>



<p>You can do this by going to <strong>LearnDash &gt; Lessons</strong>. Create a new lesson or edit an existing one. Then add a Document Library Pro shortcode block at the bottom of the content.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/eT9a82do0o-BMmi38Whh4Jo9u7dxOQOJKc7if1c96pOa8uaMWDS4mLVM43rHtANFCpgHoCDwLCHUUKyIfECPzFvjQxpPN33JuSc_TsVsn9VEh-C_d7-PBRqY3q2YkbQkCZtv6TvU2g7ezPbxP3KVD4hBbqUpIRc8NY_unbgf_FcLRgALvptqYo.png" width="602" height="380"></p>

<h3 id="h-extra-customization-options-for-your-learndash-course-materials-library">Extra Customization Options for Your LearnDash Course Materials Library</h3>



<p>Document Library Pro allows you to customize your library’s look and feel in different ways. For example, you can choose to display your course materials in a grid rather than a table. All you need to do is navigate to <strong>Document &gt; Settings </strong>and scroll down to the <strong>Default layout </strong>section and check <strong>Grid</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/ap-Et4pCFt0UF2PgZR-yvsL_Nyu-gRaxJuqI7gzN3NL37K0g_u2jSplv5tPYUlZMx7JWxtLmWHOq3xvsUmmFHbqeW3plG-OdzCthN9MtuqaAWJCGmgEPvG02rfI3_3FJjiuhvrH6ckwBrEsq9uHWLtb3nStMnm42L1laP4Gyly4gOjJLNguVBQ.png" width="602" height="344"></p>



<p>Here’s what the results should look like:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Ci2NI09S_yMdBznt1KgLFvKAF6sFCe2SK7z46c0rQMCx4afX0uSXg7pnu4k_IAiaFOVKcAVL_t9f9Gv3WRZc9woUt-H4VFHfHyuce6Ey0hPy8wnFOmNhBTiBA1_bYwpvomVX9AEkuPn4ZE-npHLuOxjuL1t5qFODp17dQ8Yohbe3LqbUH9emG_w.png" width="602" height="325"></p>



<p>Similarly, you can enable folder view on the same page by checking <strong>Display the document library in folders</strong>. This is a perfect way to create a well-organized hierarchical structure for eLearning sites with multiple course materials categories.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/lUAdqeZqTSNCRg_k2HEyYsJMe1YVQWjNiWN7L-0lnQIBA2VQZH3Ong_eCZAzoPDD87GvZmzPQOpWmBnBiuWK9RtZMIyIWRECgf7qcLnmcs9ZKcRT6LpODDKUu4gJGubPlUZhO75Fw4Qp-IZmxouA1zesib-_JC6fCFu1H1C3nLGQoEMLY7f84uA.png" width="602" height="232"></p>



<p>Another important feature is the search function. You can include the search box above or below the course materials list, or both. Alternatively, you can even hide the feature completely and display it somewhere else using a shortcode or widget.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/L2boEd4gbdfP2Py0zCIGeB16q8pwchLc5fkAU4XRtLUNDmaC-bam6plDyRuzNkmkss9qadhePwdJULA_txK_HLqaQHHeUsVPItKjSzf2MemZ-ylJcl_UoX5EiigG_mEn65jr3gFZOr3l6bmWQPVF-BXMa1XXehPr_xnEDLsFfRYHPXnWB2ksB50.png" width="602" height="227"></p>



<h3 id="h-improve-your-learndash-site-with-a-searchable-course-materials-library">Improve Your LearnDash Site With a Searchable Course Materials Library&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Adding a searchable course materials library to your LearnDash site has many benefits. With the ability to search and filter materials, students can easily find what they need, improving their engagement with the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Document Library Pro</a> allows you to add course materials to the main LearnDash course page, the &#8220;Materials&#8221; tab, the course sidebar, and individual lessons. It also gives you control over the look and feel of your course materials library.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you need to add resources one at a time or in bulk, Document Library Pro plugin offers all the control you need. Add this useful plugin to your LearnDash site and see how it improves your courses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New to LearnDash, or considering using it as your LMS?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We get a lot of questions from new customers who are considering our LMS for their online course. For many educators, this is their first experience putting together a website, let alone an online course. Others may have more experience with WordPress and its ecosystem of plugins, but may still be unsure how LearnDash fits into it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe the best customer is an informed one. So, we’ve rounded up answers to some of the questions we hear most frequently from new or prospective customers. If you’re thinking of using LearnDash as your LMS, here are the top 9 things you need to know.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Is WordPress required for LearnDash to operate?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, LearnDash is a WordPress LMS plugin, which means that you will need WordPress installed for LearnDash to operate.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/should-you-use-wordpress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the top Content Management System (CMS) in the world. LearnDash harnesses those capabilities and expands them to encompass e-learning as well. You don’t need to pay an additional fee for WordPress. You can install </span><a href="https://wordpress.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for free.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>2. What about my wordpress.com site? Isn’t that the same as wordpress.org?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many users don’t realize that the WordPress brand comprises two different components: a for-profit company selling hosted websites at wordpress.com, and the non-profit wordpress.org branch run by the WordPress foundation. It’s confusing, we know. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><b>do not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommend users try to run LearnDash on a wordpress.com site. While it will technically work if you have purchased the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows for premium plugins, it doesn’t run as smoothly. Instead, our advice is to go the self-hosted route through wordpress.org and install WordPress on your own domain with your own hosting where you have more control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If setting up your hosting seems daunting, then we recommend you check out our </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/learndash-cloud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash Cloud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> services, where hosting comes included.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Can I use LearnDash with my current theme?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash is designed to integrate with most modern WordPress themes. This means that you should be able to safely install it on your site and begin using its features without compromising the current design of your site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there are a couple scenarios in which this might not work for you:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>If you’re using an outdated theme.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If this is the case, we suggest you picking a new theme, as older themes tend to fall behind best practices for usability and mobile-friendliness. </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/themes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are some suggested themes you can check out.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>If you’ve custom-coded something particular into your current site</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If this is the case, you can contact our support team to ask about your specific situation. While custom development is outside our support scope, we may be able to help point you in the right direction.&nbsp; That said, if you know enough to deploy custom coding on your site, you know enough to make it work with LearnDash.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is a major concern, you can also install LearnDash on a </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/should-you-use-a-subdomain-for-learndash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">subdomain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which should resolve any potential conflicts with the theme on your main site.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Do I have to be a developer to use LearnDash?</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/do-you-have-to-be-a-developer-to-use-learndash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not have to be a developer to use LearnDash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As long as you have a basic level of technical savvy, you should find the setup straight-forward. We’ve built the plugin at the lowest barrier-to-entry possible, even for those who don’t know how to code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who don’t have the technical confidence to set up your own site, don’t worry!&nbsp; LearnDash Cloud may be the perfect solution for you. LearnDash Cloud is a fully-hosted WordPress website that comes with LearnDash pre-installed and includes professionally-designed starter templates that are easy to customize. To learn more, watch our </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/webinar-learndash-cloud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Started With LearnDash Cloud webinar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-reasons-learndash-is-the-best-lms-for-developers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you are a developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—or if you have access to developers—then LearnDash is also a great solution. It gives you more flexibility than any of the hosted LMS platforms could possibly offer. It’s the best of both worlds!.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. What is the difference between LearnDash Plugin and LearnDash Cloud?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash now offers two subscription options:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.learndash.com/learndash-cloud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash Cloud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is ready to go “out-of-the-box,” with no need for additional hosting or fuss. You’ll have an entire website and access to the entire ecosystem that comes along with WordPress.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/pricing-and-purchase/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash Plugin </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">is excellent for anyone who already has an existing WordPress site and is simply looking to add a learning management system. This includes, but is not limited to, WordPress developers who have clients requesting an LMS, organizations with a focus on training, and educational institutions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>6. Will LearnDash help me create and run my website?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, LearnDash support does not help create and run our customers&#8217; sites. If you are looking for some help getting your site up and running, then the LearnDash Cloud may be a good fit for you. After purchasing, you will go through our simple </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/getting-started/the-onboarding-wizard/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onboarding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/learndash-cloud/how-to-use-the-design-wizard/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wizards to set up your site. From there, you can edit the content and start adding your courses!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you could also consider hiring a developer to help create and run your site.&nbsp; A qualified developer can also help you with customizations as well so that your course looks and operates exactly how you want it to. A great place to find a qualified developer is through our </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1020920397944393/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Group.</span></a></p>
<h3><b>7. Does LearnDash store my data?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to purchase the LearnDash Plugin, then your data would be stored on your hosting providers servers.&nbsp; However, if you decide to go with LearnDash Cloud, then your data will be stored with </span><a href="https://www.nexcess.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexcess</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (our sister company) and your data will be automatically backed up every 24 hours.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>8. How many sites can I use my LearnDash license on?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LearnDash Plugin currently offers a few different license options: 1 site, 10 sites, and Unlimited sites. Each site uses one license, including subdomains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you have yoursite.com, yourothersite.com, and learndash.yoursite.com, that would use 3 of your licenses, since they would all run their own instance of LearnDash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide to go with the LearnDash Cloud, you will receive one license for your subscription.</span></p>
<h3><b>9. How do the payments work? Will LearnDash charge a transaction fee?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LearnDash does not collect fees based on your course sales and has no direct involvement in your customers payment transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer three payment gateway integrations so you can collect payments: PayPal, Stripe, or RazorPay.&nbsp; The payment gateway you select will be the company handling the transaction process. Once the transaction is complete, it will trigger LearnDash to enroll the user into the appropriate course.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, please keep in mind the payment processor you select will have their own fees in place. We suggest researching the various options available and what they charge for their services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If none of the built-in payment gateways work for your needs, then we suggest checking out WooCommerce which has over </span><a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=1023&amp;collections=product&amp;page=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70 different payment gateway integrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Do research so you know you’re making the best choice.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many excellent reasons to choose LearnDash for your LMS. However, we might not be the right choice for everyone. We welcome questions and feedback, as it means our customers are doing their research and choosing the platform that fits their needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions, please feel free to </span><a href="https://www.learndash.com/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we will be happy to answer your questions. If you’d like to try LearnDash before you buy, check out our demo and experience LearnDash both as a learner and a course creator. </span></p>

<p>Creating an online course is more of an art than a science. There isn’t a strict formula for success—but there are a few elements that most successful courses share in common. One of those elements is a course outline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A clear, engaging content outline serves both you and your learners as you start mapping out a new course. Creating an outline can also help ensure your course content aligns with your goals for your students.</p>



<p>Wondering how to get started compiling your outline? In this post, we’ll walk you through all the steps to create a winning course outline.</p>



<h2><strong>What is a course outline?</strong></h2>



<p>A course outline quite literally outlines the content of your course. It provides the game plan as you begin mapping out the sections, lessons, quizzes, and other content you plan to include in your course.</p>



<p>It can be tempting to skip the outline and dive right into creating content for your course—but resist that urge. A course outline will help ensure you’re compiling a solid course before you get too deep in the process.</p>



<h2><strong>A step-by-step course outline guide</strong></h2>



<p>Getting started is the hardest part of any new endeavor. Luckily, you don’t have to spin your wheels on your course outline. These simple, actionable steps will take you from course concept to course outline in no time.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Identify your learners and their goals.</strong></h2>



<p>Start out by centering your focus and identifying your end-users—the students who will be taking your course.</p>



<p>Some questions to consider:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Who are your learners?&nbsp;</li><li>What are they trying to achieve?</li><li>What are they struggling with?&nbsp;</li><li>How will your course help them achieve their goals?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Asking yourself these simple questions will sharpen your focus and keep you on track as you create an outline tailored to your audience.</p>



<h2><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Create a roadmap to the desired outcome.</strong></h2>



<p>Now that you’ve identified your learners and their motivations, it’s time to create a framework for how they’ll reach their goals. Maybe their goal is to know a few conversational phrases in Italian by the end of the course; maybe the goal is to earn a professional certification.</p>



<p>Think of the roadmap as a bare-bones first draft of your outline. It simply plots out the route from the beginning to the end of your course.</p>



<p><strong><em>Related post: </em></strong><a href="http://learndash.com/how-to-structure-an-online-course/"><strong><em>How to Structure an Online Course</em></strong></a></p>



<p>Your starting point should be a simple introduction. No matter your course topic, every course should begin with an introduction of key concepts. Remember: Your learners may not all start from the same place. Some students may need a quick overview before diving into course content.</p>



<p>Use <a href="https://www.gcu.edu/blog/teaching-school-administration/what-scaffolding-education">scaffolding strategies</a> as you identify the subsequent sections in your course roadmap. As you go, be mindful of the course progression. Your sections should serve as building blocks that start simple and move toward more complex ideas. Don’t introduce a complicated topic or idea too early in the course; work your way up to the big takeaways.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Reinforce learning.</strong></h2>



<p>After each step in your content roadmap, you’ll want to feature an element that helps make learning stick for your students.</p>



<p>What does this look like? It could mean designating a review at the end of each section with links out to additional reading materials, videos, or resources. Or it could mean quizzing students after each section to test their understanding. You could also close each section with an essay question where students can put concepts into practice.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Start putting the pieces together.</strong></h2>



<p>Once you’ve sketched out a roadmap for your course, it’s time to flesh out your course outline with detailed sections and lesson titles.</p>



<p>For each section of your course, consider the following:</p>



<ul><li>What is the medium? Will the section be presented as text, a video, or a combination of mediums?</li><li>What are your talking points for each lesson? What information do you need to convey?</li><li>How does this section build upon the previous sections? How does it segue into the following section?</li><li>How does this section tie back to the learners’ goals?</li></ul>



<p>By now, you’ll have a thorough content outline for your course. All that’s left is the final step: Building your course.</p>

<p>Learning and education is one area that transcends language. In fact, we all need quality and comprehensive education, no matter if we speak one common language, or have multilingual skills. As such, if you run an online course, it’s a good idea to cater to more than one language.</p>



<p>Depending on your chosen approach though, this could be a daunting task. First, you’ll need something that combines and integrates with your choice of Learning Management System (LMS.) From there, you’ll need to create and manage the translations and make sure your site has a number of technical considerations in place.</p>



<p>As such, for this post, let’s look at how to translate an online course. We’ll cover a lot of ground, and at the end, show you how to use one standout translation service to save time, effort, and headaches.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-you-d-want-to-translate-your-online-course">Why you’d want to translate your online course</h2>



<p>Regardless of whether you speak one language or a number of them, you’ll likely appreciate content in a specific primary text. For example, around <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?tid=ACSDP5Y2019.DP02&amp;hidePreview=true">20 percent of people</a> in the United States speak at least a second language. This means 80 percent would need to consume content in a single language. If your online course uses English, so far so good.</p>



<p>However, consider the other 20 percent. There’s no assumption that of the multiple languages they speak, English is the primary one. In fact, in the US, over <a href="https://www.amacad.org/humanities-indicators/public-life/multilingualism#31760">half of multilingual people</a> speak Spanish at home.</p>



<p>Also, this is only based on a single country. For a standard online course, you’ll attract learners from around the world. Some of these people will likely have some degree of multilingual skill, but not everyone.</p>



<p>As such, if you run an online course, there will likely be a need to present the lessons and content in <a href="https://www.learndash.com/4-basic-language-skills-to-cover-in-an-online-course/">many different languages</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-you-ll-want-to-translate-on-your-course-website">What you’ll want to translate on your course website</h2>



<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty with regards to how to translate your online course, you’ll want to understand <em>what</em> to translate. It’s a fallacy to assume that you’ll only need to translate the core content. There are lots of other aspects of your LMS and site that should take a multilingual approach:</p>



<ul><li>Your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/the-importance-of-evolving-your-course-material/">course material</a> and supplementary assets.</li><li>Closed captioning and subtitles if your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/using-videos-in-online-courses/">course uses video</a>.</li><li>Speaking of which, the text of your video should also use whatever language the learner is comfortable with. Same goes for images too.</li></ul>



<p>There are also some site-agnostic technical elements that you should always translate too:</p>



<ul><li>Your metadata, such as categories, tags, and other taxonomies.</li><li>The URLs your site uses should also reflect the primary language that you are translating to.</li></ul>



<p>This latter concept can send you down a rabbit hole, but it’s necessary for success. We’re going to talk about this next.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-technical-needs-of-a-multilingual-website">The technical needs of a multilingual website</h2>



<p>Your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) must be ‘on point’ in order to stand any chance of visitors finding your website. For an online course, traffic is vital and SEO is one of the ways to do it.</p>



<p>However, there are also specific <a href="https://weglot.com/4-key-seo-tips-multilingual-website/?fp_ref=zach67">multilingual SEO</a> concerns you’ll need to factor into any work you do to translate your online course. Other than your metadata and URLs, you’ll want to look into and implement the following:</p>



<ul><li>First, a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/make-sure-to-test-your-course-user-experience/">User Experience (UX)</a> concern. You’ll want to keep to one language per page. There are a few reasons for this, but your main issues will be with consistency in context and site usability. As such, you should ensure that every piece of content and metadata for individual pages has translation.</li><li>You’ll want to arm and employ yourself with knowledge about <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/hreflang-tag"><strong>hreflang</strong> tags</a>. These are a building block of multilingual SEO, and as such, will be vital to translate and present your online course.</li></ul>



<p>The latter is a HTML meta tag that helps a search engine serve the right page language to the correct region for its use. It will have a rigid structure, and you’ll enter it into the head of your page. For example…:</p>



<p>&lt;link rel=”alternate” hreflang=”fr-ca” href=”http://example.com/fr/” /&gt;</p>



<p>…references a French language page for readers specific to French Canadian speakers. It’s a complicated, time-consuming task that has little margin for error. However, it’s necessary to implement – although there are ways you can do so without a second thought.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-different-methods-you-d-use-to-translate-any-site">The different methods you’d use to translate any site</h2>



<p>There are a few different ways to translate a site, but not many can serve as your primary tactic. For example, you could argue that with the translation tools you find in some modern browsers, there is no need to provide translated content.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/qBrzyP5HhWOSBXISFgB7BuwrnsQR_yJYDoFhD2RElZru6LiSbHIsRl9I8gCYjmT3J9ICkIkZhwiMcnXe_Q847pcVNMcV6I9zhQFwt4ALTz-Yw1heJky5cqyUy7tel2y2qvx9dGJEm5zApDfrDxn_PH4.png" alt="A browser bar translation tool within the Brave browser."/></figure>



<p>However, this has two big issues. First, you have no control over the translated experience, how it looks on the front end, and what content gets a translation. This can be a nightmare for the UX of your site, and drive users away to other sites that care more.</p>



<p>Second, the translations might not be accurate. This is true for all so-called ‘machine translation’ tools. While the accuracy continues to improve, you’ll always want some level of control and editing rights over what’s being displayed on your website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This manual approach will be one of (if not) <em>the</em> most accurate ways to translate your online course. You’re able to pass off content to an expert with proven (and sometimes accredited) skills, then work with them to refine the content until it’s perfect. The drawback is the time and money you’ll need to factor into the approach.</p>



<p>Instead, there is a third way – one that combines the best of machine and manual translation strategies.</p>



<h3 id="h-using-wordpress-plugins-to-help-with-translations">Using WordPress plugins to help with translations</h3>



<p>For <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> users, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-must-have-wordpress-plugins-for-education/">plugins can bridge the gap</a> between a default installation and an all-action, full-featured website. If your site lacks functionality in an area you desire, a plugin can bring it in. For example, you can add plugins to help integrate contact forms, payment gateways – even LMS setups.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/wKUvsvoW7XtNzZSw7MLtpNlu_okrYVmX-b8m5fFUmfseGFOJZIVFLgV48M9G0htFvEIxcxC087Ej5X3M_9i72XkzqETTrn8qUGcUbfsSCaGI6oeNqLUBtO74VVDo_lmoDhC7yWc5iUnNvKI22DuKxKI.png" alt="The LearnDash dashboard."/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/">LearnDash</a> is the most powerful LMS for WordPress, and there are lots of reputable developers that cover other niches too. For example, WordPress can offer a multitude of translation plugins and services for your site. Not all of these will cost money – the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress Plugin Directory</a> contains thousands of full-featured plugins with no price attached.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/VtHuV8K1M5CGLHev_NojE0UPRh5vCF2Q_2f5np9Nr1y5G5sQLuLgrMvjec9NZhwtjMGd1M5KVscqh-AwSW2w-fUcHk2RL7S18lnjKxjH8qemSgGXvCt16agRKdlicdkdvnJDvoHrUFvZ02fd-_4Ii6I.png" alt="The WordPress Plugin Directory."/></figure>



<p>However, you’ll likely want to pay a premium upgrade to access better support, further features, and regular updates from the development team. If you want to use a popular and prominent WordPress translation plugin, keep reading!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-weglot-can-bring-to-your-online-courses">What Weglot can bring to your online courses</h2>



<p>If you want the equivalent of LearnDash’s quality but for your translations, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/weglot">Weglot</a> is the service for you. It’s a major player for multilingual websites, and lets you (and the likes of DoorDash, HBO, and United Nations) spin up translated content in seconds. All without code.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/IUcdXodSAE3uMENYZ6kSXFi4e6rfgHbX2h7jM9dA1xEq1KgMiDyQGIR1B40ZijMFlrcdE-p7XAHNKTat7tG3qFtWDcmigE4AXbyW5AlNcgoXhf4xpS9ymQk6S7CgaUfZBESBlwvLnCg6CA3-pS4AOrI.png" alt="The Weglot logo and graphic banner."/></figure>



<p>Weglot comes with a mountain of features, lots of functionality, and supreme ease of use in the following ways:</p>



<ul><li>It translates every part of your website – including metadata and visual assets – using a first layer of machine translation. This <a href="https://weglot.com/blog/machine-translation-software/?fp_ref=learndash">automatic translation</a> takes its power from some of the best in the field (such as <a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a>, <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator//">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://translate.yandex.com/">Yandex</a>.)</li><li>From there, you can dig into each individual translated ‘string’ using the Weglot custom dashboard. Alternatively, you can order professional translators to perfect your copy or add your own translation team.</li><li>There’s an in-context editor to show you how translations will look on the page, and edit from it if necessary.</li></ul>



<p>What’s more, Weglot applies all of the typical practices for multilingual SEO without the need to lift a finger. It uses the most optimal URL structures, helps you index pages with search engines for maximum visibility, and more.</p>



<p>Weglot’s starts from <a href="https://weglot.com/pricing/?fp_ref=learndash">$9.90 per month</a> for a single site and 10,000 translated words. However, you can scale upwards if you have greater needs. There’s also a <a href="https://dashboard.weglot.com/register?fp_ref=learndash">ten-day free trial available</a>, so you can take the service for a spin before you spend your money.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-translate-your-online-course-using-weglot-in-3-steps">How to translate your online course using Weglot (in 3 steps)</h2>



<p>Before you begin to use Weglot, you should sign up for a 10-day free trial, install and activate the plugin on your site. The good news is that this is similar to <a href="https://weglot.com/documentation/setup-guides/wordpress/?fp_ref=learndash">other WordPress plugins</a>, so if you are familiar with the approach, you’ll be good to go in seconds.</p>



<p>Once you have things ready, take a look at the <em>Weglot</em> screen on your WordPress dashboard. This will let you enter your API key here. However, there are a couple more fields to fill in. Let’s look at this next.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-add-languages">1. Add languages&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The Weglot tab in WordPress is where you’ll first set the languages you’d like to offer on your site. You’ll choose options from two different fields:</p>



<ul><li>The original language of your site – i.e. choose the current language you use.</li><li>All of the destination languages you’d like. These will be all of the languages you’d like to translate into.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/neDDJR0FQv4jAUbdEz9E2JL8US8sN-eI42J1LHs7TvYoSuSVvC0KX6eaCo7ayyHB9ZAjEzu6lV84LgVVFjSeHMUSBONhclPRTkrNVkFaPB-QsIIPI7euEVzbNANnqJNO62y3s2r5-C7tWU5l3Q3Q4eI.png" alt="The Weglot settings page, showing a search result for a destination language."/></figure>



<p>The first time you save your changes, you’ll see a success message and your online course will have been translated into the languages of your choice! As mentioned before this is using a first layer of automatic translation (we’ll show you how to edit those translations further down).&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-2-customize-the-language-switcher">2. Customize the language switcher</h3>



<p>With the number of potential languages you will translate your online course into, there needs to be an easy way for a visitor to access them all. The language switcher is a small menu located on every page that lets you select the language, which will then change the text on site:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/JfkDhpfi9SU_PdOHhmee0g_3CaBKl4K8Qht7NfVB5SU13xCviOf0KFNyh-WmFDNL8z7NRFGJJDgB0pH6zbFqMF1Iaj_RdMUNtl959qUzwv06F5MOAWUBmKvPzkwj6osqb8huu8Raea_IHeHsKbZKtjM.png" alt="The language switcher on the front end of a site."/></figure>



<p>There are a multitude of options to help you set this up too:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/naKJf2NNMAnwskIi3C_Ym6_FnbrwaQNnyghJhKQFIGcTE-5ENjqyIgdY4sEn1EkGuL68GkWStO6gbYqQl5lTkFt6aJWbFpwZweF4fP3aem_fIaEzbs5xKBPqNH6weRIJlxkooq99NtRU89d-p6-iMBI.png" alt="The language switcher options within WordPress."/></figure>



<p>For example, you can set whether country flags display and in what format, change the format of the switcher to a drop-down menu, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news is that the language switcher will always be present as soon as you install Weglot. From here, you can look to translate the content on your site.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-access-the-weglot-dashboard-to-begin-to-translate-your-online-course">3. Access the Weglot Dashboard to begin to translate your online course</h3>



<p>The Weglot Dashboard gives you access to editing your translations. While we can’t dive into every option here, you’ll want to head straight to the <em>Translations</em> screen to see how Weglot’s machine translations have translated your site.</p>



<p>Here, you can select from a number of different screens. For example, you can see an overview of the languages you offer, a collection of translated URLs and ‘slugs’ for your site, and even order professional translations.</p>



<p>However, there are two other important screens. First, on the <em>Languages</em> screen, you can click any option to look at a line-by-line breakdown of your translation:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/J0ShKfGVYKpacc2WcMgYd9nEvrF9CCQPSj-ktjuECIJ2ryHfQN_vHmoj765xICdHE_9gZ9aV4pnODC-Kvb6afypYmWjUf7PKaanaGNneNSSVB-vWUG8UJB7cj98tgTeIwEvAQU9D2mm9XZirvFKhWNY.png" alt="The language switcher options within WordPress."/></figure>



<p>Each line provides further information and preview options, along with the ability to mark the line as ‘reviewed.’</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/2WumqxfbaVorzP_opWjZVahr2V0HZDKmBMDM0oNM3Rh8KjM0hhkxb1ADnYtzzegarnwM7lkuu75hx1_GzNIumkrFirQYBddPpVR-jXZrGgKbkKtQzhaVFPjCJ0yMj2jBm9z5Q7TE93sIOtwGGirc4AU.png" alt="Showing the information for a translated line within Weglot’s dashboard."/></figure>



<p>The other important option here is to open the line in the Visual Editor. This gives you access to how the translations will look on the front end of your site:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/0jXzs4qblFbTFv3wBBlIi6rCEsSv5EmXwmyCW_J_7lWZt7pxbeP_V2uRBRA6Mz5k18vYXPeLrRIvrBanJKPkvP1dFfUML8noulPphX-GJuYX9u2mTHecEHqW4erbPfPFcKY19XW67I-mnMC8D2DzE4s.png" alt="The Weglot Visual Editor."/></figure>



<p>You’re able to use the language switcher as you would on the live site, but you can edit each translation in place based on how it looks and reads:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/C-L39908c3CBEyA-tjQoEY0ajapUKhcwQlhCSgi5Lr5gQEQGEuU0FBke0fq2KnDqWl_Hju9DKnBr1i9aHNWxoHmWh-cHxn_DVenXATOKstes4lMRZfpFJVP5zfseYom9UKGTYzolgp1EhDiMZaOhLU.png" alt="Editing text using the Weglot Visual Editor."/></figure>



<p>As such, you can work with the translations as the end user will read them. It’s an ideal, no-code solution to translate an online course – or any other site.</p>



<h2 id="h-wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>



<p>There are few more global pursuits than the need for learning. What’s more, education can be big business – especially if you offer an online course that is popular and valuable. While you might already use a solution such as LearnDash as your LMS, translating your content for those global users needs another quality solution.</p>



<p>Weglot is a <a href="https://weglot.com/integrations/wordpress-translation-plugin/?fp_ref=learndash">WordPress translation plugin</a> with a solid pedigree and stellar reputation. It can help you translate an entire site in minutes – without the need for code – and implement complex technical requirements too. Whether you like to use high-powered machine translation, or pore over each line, Weglot can be an ideal translation service.</p>

<p>We’re pleased to announce the latest feature to come to LearnDash, Import/Export!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Import/Export is the easiest way to transfer your existing LearnDash data into a new site or server and is the best way to migrate to LearnDash Cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below, we’ll explore how to use this new feature and when you might be likely to implement it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-does-it-work">How Does it Work?</h3>



<p>First you’ll need to upgrade to LearnDash 4.3 or above. Then, navigate to your <em>wp-admin -&gt; LearnDash LMS -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Import/Export</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/hkVfmgEccbvE68SfTRdU_fpkXdpjWW6kessBIQGWPerI0mykwybh-APYH7u7CxDDs6QtYoO0dueV_GuuNnzmR2pHI9Y0ZMDaYyRh-QTiQDmWO9eC6aDgnisBkGijsiuERz3iUFvqjFXH1SW3cHk.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>From here, you can choose what you want to export: everything in your course, or a specific post types. For example, if you want to use lessons you’ve created on LearnDash on a different site, you might simply choose to export only the lessons you need, and not export the parent course itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The import feature is straightforward as well: choose your file to import, and your materials will be integrated into your LearnDash course.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-who-is-import-export-for">Who is Import/Export for?</h3>



<p>Well, everyone! Your content is valuable; it’s likely you’ll want to share it in multiple ways. In particular, here are a few cases that really sing to the ability of import/export:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Migrating your LearnDash content to a new site/server for testing</li>



<li>Switching from using LearnDash to using LearnDash Cloud&nbsp;</li>



<li>Re-using your content on another website&nbsp;</li>



<li>Migrating user progress to a new site (we know you’ve all wanted that one for some time!)</li>
</ul>



<p>These examples are just scratching the surface of the use cases for the Import/Export feature. Once you start exploring the feature for yourself, you’ll find plenty of instances where you’ll rely on the Import/Export feature to carry your content in between various courses, platforms, and sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as you’d expect – it’s simple to use as well. Here’s us exporting our courses in less than 17 seconds!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Jyl4jaeQHizZEefKKwhvHgafC8i3PIsNLkDEUmqa50iQ4-6yFYH4F-I3eQwTetGG8PqsBOsngMAdEpR0tdmgTKZE-fho0hAWNkRObGIummtY7ZQ8i1qc_3HSKMb4tFA-QIFqpIzU2tjsQ2JsMgM.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Import/Export was built from the ground up with scale in mind, so whether you have 50 students or 50,000 students, Import/Export can get the job done.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-coming-up">Coming Up</h3>



<p>Import/Export sets an exciting precedent for LearnDash content migration as a whole. Not only does it allow you to move between the plugin and LearnDash Cloud quickly, but it also easily forms the basis of a brand new migration tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the not too distant future, you’ll be able to import content from other LMS systems to LearnDash in a single click.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like to learn more about the ability to Import from other LMS systems and when it’s available, sign up for our email newsletter below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll show you tips and tricks for maximizing this feature as well as all of the other features available as a LearnDash customer, from course cloning to robust reporting features.</p>

<p><strong>Building your course isn&#8217;t an all-day process, especially if you use KadenceWP Starter themes for LearnDash.</strong></p>



<p>LearnDash is a learning management system that helps you easily transform your expertise into profitable courses. We lean in heavily on the “easy” part and that’s why we’re always creating new, more effective ways to build courses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our latest hack includes new starter themes from KadenceWP. In this post, we&#8217;ll show you the power and flexibility of Kadence and how it can help you create your course website in record time.</p>



<p>But first…</p>



<h2><strong>About KadenceWP</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Kadence is a member of our StellarWP family and they produce amazing themes that will take your course design to the next level. They’re focused on creating “clean and professional class WordPress themes that help everyday people create beautiful websites.”</p>



<p>Last year, they released three customizable starter templates that were created specifically for your LearnDash courses. It’s the easiest way to build better course pages.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-design-2-1-1024x576.png" alt="Kandence Themes for LearnDash" class="wp-image-29650"/></figure>



<h2><strong>Getting started with Kadence Starter Themes for LearnDash</strong></h2>



<p>Before you begin, you need to have LearnDash installed on your website.</p>



<p><strong>Installing LearnDash</strong></p>



<p>Step 1: Go to wp-admin &gt; plugins &gt; Add new &gt; Upload.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 2: Select the zip file that was downloaded from support.learndash.com&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 3: Activate the plugin and activate your license key</p>



<p>You’ll then navigate to the <a href="https://www.kadencewp.com/kadence-theme/starter-templates/">Kadence Starter Templates</a> to download your templates and install them on your course site.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Installing Kadence</strong></p>



<p>Step 1: Go to wp-admin &gt; Appearance&gt; Themes &gt; Add new.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 2: Search for Kadence and click install</p>



<p>Step 3: Activate the Kadence theme&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: Please ensure that you are importing the Kadence themes on a new, blank website. Importing Kadence on a site that has content will override any existing content.</p>



<p><strong>Deciding which Kadence Starter Theme is right for your course</strong></p>



<p>Once you have LearnDash and Kadence installed, you’re ready to create your course. But how do you select a theme that’s best for your course site?</p>



<p>When choosing a theme, you’ll need to take into consideration what theme best represents your brand. The Kadence themes are fully customizable so once you choose the themes you can edit it to add your brand’s colors and move things around to fit your brand style.</p>



<p>If you need more themes or theme options, try Kadence Pro. You’ll gain access to exclusive features like custom fonts, header addons, custom menus, and more.</p>



<p>Building your course shouldn’t feel intimidating. With LearnDash and the new Kadence Starter themes, you can create beautiful courses in less time and with less confusion.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>If you structure an online course well, you&#8217;ll keep people engaged</h2>



<p>Have you ever sat in a lecture – clearly presented by an expert – only to discover that you&#8217;re bored out of your mind and can&#8217;t stay awake? In my series focused on&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/category/online-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online courses</a>, we&#8217;ve covered&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/who-should-create-an-online-course-and-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who should create a course</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/how-to-come-up-with-an-idea-for-your-online-course/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to come up with course topics</a>, but now we need to work on keeping an audience engaged. That means we have to look at how to structure an online course.</p>



<p>If you do it right, people will not only love you, but they&#8217;ll tell everyone they know about your course. If you don&#8217;t do it right, you&#8217;ll sell it to 6 people and wonder about the life choices that brought you here.</p>



<h2>Two mistakes you want to avoid</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re structuring your next course, there are two mistakes that you have to avoid. Let&#8217;s make sure we cover those quickly.</p>



<p><strong>First, most people won&#8217;t become experts just by taking your course</strong>. So stop trying to create the course with the absolute most details ever. Feel free to name your course (in your head), “An introduction to…” as that will help you steer clear of creating an overwhelming amount of detailed content.</p>



<p><strong>Second, most people don&#8217;t have unlimited time to watch your lessons</strong>. So stop recording hour long lessons. Create content that is consumable in shorter amounts of time (2-3 minutes for some, 5-15 minutes for other topics). Allowing people to consume content in chunks doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t let them watch for an hour straight. But if you record an hour, people will wait to watch the lesson until they know they have the time – which is never!</p>



<p>Ok, now that we have those out of the way, we can get into the process of creating a structure for your online course content.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-start-with-the-goal">First, start with the goal</h2>



<p>People sign up for an online course because they want something. They want to be able to do something they&#8217;ve already tried to do without you, or they&#8217;re trying to do something they&#8217;ve never tried. Either way, the place to start isn&#8217;t step one. The place to start is the end.</p>



<p>By doing this, you help them see what taking your course will do for them. They&#8217;ll think, “If I can do this when I finish the course, it will be worth it.”</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re structuring your next course without this, if you start at the pre-requisites, or step one, you&#8217;re likely jumping into the material too quickly. And a result of that is that people feel the pressure early and not the hope you want them to have.</p>



<p>So start with the end in mind.</p>



<h2 id="h-then-articulate-a-strategy">Then, articulate a strategy</h2>



<p>Let me pause for a second and address another insecurity you might have. We talked yesterday about the insecurity of knowing others out there have created courses like yours already.</p>



<p>Today I want to highlight that the way you go about doing something, the something you&#8217;re teaching, may not be the only way. And you may feel stressed about that. You may worry that you&#8217;re showing people how to create a landing page without coding, and the “without coding” part stresses you out.</p>



<p>I hope that&#8217;s not happening. But I hear it a lot.</p>



<p>So let me introduce you to a great element to put early into your course outline. It&#8217;s the “strategy” component.</p>



<p>After you hit the first part of your course – where you talk about the goal and end result – I find it helpful to articulate why you&#8217;re going to approach the problem the way you&#8217;re going to do it. And why you&#8217;re not approaching it another way.</p>



<p>This is where you address “why” in your course outline. It&#8217;s powerful because you present it early. And it can eliminate your worry and insecurities.</p>



<p>For example, if I&#8217;m creating a course on landing pages, I might create a lesson called, “Why I embrace the no-code approach by using page builders.”</p>



<p>Helping people connect with the strategy behind your approach may also help your customers by eliminating questions they may have had.</p>



<h2 id="h-now-present-common-challenges">Now, present common challenges</h2>



<p>Think about the last course you took. No wait. Think about the last “tutorial” video you watched on YouTube. Had you already tried to solve the problem on your own?</p>



<p>Most of the people who buy your course may have already tried things. And when they struggled to accomplish their goal, they may not have understood why things hadn&#8217;t worked as they expected.</p>



<p>As I mentioned in my post the other day,&nbsp;<a href="https://chrislema.com/teaching-soft-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing frameworks after initial efforts helps with sense making</a>.</p>



<p>So my approach to your course outline is to help them understand why those things didn&#8217;t work. I explore it by looking at common mistakes or challenges that we regularly face.</p>



<p>It helps people understand what hasn&#8217;t worked and gets them excited that you know the way to get past these challenges. Again, it delivers hope – which helps students stay engaged and want to keep moving forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-help-them-move-forward">Next, help them move forward</h2>



<p>When it comes to the structure an online course, all the previous stuff is critical, but it&#8217;s just setting the stage for this section. You needed the other stuff earlier, so you can point back to it. You needed it to set the stage for this.</p>



<p>But this is the core of the material that helps them move from A to B.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t give them every possible path or route. Stick to the main roads they&#8217;ll need to travel. Focus on the main approach to learning what they need to learn.</p>



<p>And be ruthless about eliminating anything that is a distraction, or right for the experts. It won&#8217;t help you.</p>



<p>Focus on how to help people take the simplest steps to move forward. It&#8217;s the instructional component of the course.</p>



<h2 id="h-lastly-connect-people">Lastly, connect people</h2>



<p>Group projects. Ugh.</p>



<p>Just writing the phrase makes me shiver. But there&#8217;s power in bringing people together and having them work collaboratively. Not because you want to see the results. But because you want different people, with different experiences, to bring more than your single feedback loop to the table.</p>



<p>Of course, if you don&#8217;t have a facility for cohort learning, then you have to approach the community differently.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not saying you have to have a Facebook Group – but you need a way for people to connect with each other. The community aspect of your course is something you may initially think of as extra – but I want to highly recommend it. Because it helps people move thru the material easier when they&#8217;re working with others.</p>



<h2>Does this sound familiar?</h2>



<p>Have you watched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTgJGcwKKyw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the video of my Bridge Framework</a>? Because as you read this post, I hoped you started thinking, “wait, I&#8217;ve heard him talk about this before.”</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, this structure is what I use for talks, for posts, for webinars, and even for course outlines.</p>



<p></p>

<h2>After you&#8217;ve spent time developing your course, the idea of someone stealing your course content, presenting it as their own, and even profiting from it can be terrifying.</h2>



<p>Content theft is a fear that every course creator has faced or will face at some point or another. You can find many articles online that share how to protect your course from being stolen using legal measures in your terms of use and even trademarking your content.</p>



<p>While these are significant preventative measures to take, these methods don&#8217;t actually stop content thieves from hotlinking your videos or copying text directly from the page.</p>



<p>The good news is that the latest 3.6 release of LearnDash gives you the ability to protect your course from content theft with the Integrity feature.</p>



<h3><strong>LearnDash Integrity Protects Your Course from Content Thieves</strong></h3>



<p>LearnDash Integrity is a brand new addition that helps secure your course with features that prevent hotlinking, concurrent logins, and content copy. You can even use reCaptcha to protect your website from spam abuse without creating friction for your learners.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how a brief breakdown of how each of the Integrity settings works:</p>



<p><strong>Prevent Hotlinking&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Hotlinking is known as the act of stealing someone&#8217;s bandwidth by linking directly to their website&#8217;s assets, such as images or videos. You can protect your videos and images by enabling the Prevent Hotlinking option.</p>



<p><strong>Prevent Concurrent Login</strong></p>



<p>Concurrent user login allows the same user to be logged in from multiple IP addresses. This is commonly seen when users share their passwords with others. You can disable concurrent logins, which only allow one user to log in to an account at a time.</p>



<p><strong>Prevent Content Copy</strong></p>



<p>Anyone can copy your course content and claim it as their own. You can prevent this by enabling the Prevent Content Copy option, which disables the right-click and copy function.</p>



<p><strong>reCAPTCHA&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Enabling the reCAPTCHA option prevents any spam or bots from creating fake registrations, comments, and submissions. You can choose to use either a checkbox v2 or invisible v2 reCaptcha.</p>



<h3><strong>How to Enable LearnDash Integrity</strong></h3>



<p>First, you’ll need to install the add-on by logging into your website. Once inside the WordPress dashboard area, go to LearnDash LMS &gt; Add-ons, then install and activate the Integrity add-on.</p>



<p>Once Integrity has been activated, you’ll see a new tab labeled &#8220;Integrity&#8221; in the LearnDash settings area. From here, you can toggle the features you want to use on or off, then Save to apply the changes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/img_6193270763865.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Remember, no method is entirely fool-proof when it comes to content thieves, but LearnDash Integrity gives you a proactive advantage to curb their attempts.</p>



<h3><strong>You Don&#8217;t Want to Miss the 3.6 Release</strong></h3>

<p>The post-registration experience is just as crucial as getting your learners to register in the first place. Sending out purchase success and <a href="https://www.learndash.com/6-tips-to-improve-user-registration-for-your-online-course/">user registration</a> emails are just a few examples of how you can improve your course experience. In our upcoming 3.6 release, you&#8217;ll be able to implement both from the LearnDash settings panel.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-happens-after-learners-register"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>What Happens After Learners Register?</strong></h3>



<p>Imagine your ideal learner searching online for a course you offer. Their search leads them to your website, where they learn about your course, complete the registration, and submit their payment. The next page your learners see is your confirmation page with the next steps, but they didn&#8217;t receive an email confirmation.</p>



<p>Although confirmations such as purchase success or new user registration emails seem insignificant, they can actually impact your learner&#8217;s experience and engagement negatively.</p>



<p>Here are a few reasons why post-purchase emails are essential;</p>



<ul><li>Confirm payment was successful</li><li>Increase learner engagement with your course</li><li>Provides an easy way to come back again</li><li>Relay any pertinent information that appeared on your website&#8217;s confirmation page</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-improving-your-course-experience"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Improving Your Course Experience</strong></strong></h3>



<p>Before our upcoming 3.6 release, you needed to use a plugin like WP SMTP connected with Send Grid and possibly an email autoresponder to send confirmation emails.</p>



<p>However, now you can set up LearnDash email notifications to keep your learners in the loop and engaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as someone completes the registration process, your site can automatically send out the following emails:</p>



<ul><li>Course Purchase Success</li><li>Group Purchase Success</li><li>New User Registration</li></ul>



<p>Each email type allows you to customize the message and even use smart tags to personalize the information in your emails. You also have the option to turn these emails on or off.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-setup-learndash-email-notifications"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong><meta charset="utf-8"><strong><meta charset="utf-8">H<strong>ow to Setup LearnDash Email Notifications</strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve made this easy for you by adding a tab for &#8220;Emails&#8221; right to the LearnDash settings areas. You can even set your own from name and email address so learners can instantly recognize you in their inbox.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/img_6192bd5ec20e6.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The new built-in email notifications won&#8217;t replace your autoresponder CRM or the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/learndash-notifications/">LearnDash Notifications</a> add-on. However, it is a solid starting point for keeping learners engaged and what to do next.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-if-you-re-a-learning-developer-understanding-your-client-s-goals-is-key-to-delivering-a-successful-project">If you’re a learning developer, understanding your client’s goals is key to delivering a successful project.</h3>



<p>We spend a lot of time on our blog writing to online educators, but a sizable portion of our userbase is comprised of <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-reasons-learndash-is-the-best-lms-for-developers/">developers who use WordPress</a> to deliver projects for clients who don’t have the time, the technical skills, or the time to learn the technical skills to set up a website for themselves. Some of our developer users are old hands in the web industry, but many are new to the work, and even those who may have been around for a while may not have handled an LMS project before.</p>



<p>For all these users, we have some great news: Our Training Specialist, James Tryon is leading a presentation in partnership with GoDaddy on how to deliver a successful LMS project. <strong><a href="https://events.godaddy.com/events/details/godaddy-events-godaddy-pro-online-presents-delivering-a-successful-lms-learning-management-system-project/">The event takes place Wednesday, July 21st at 3:00pm EST.</a></strong> We encourage you to sign up so you don’t miss out on James’ insights, which are built off of over two decades in the creative industry.</p>



<p>For those of you who aren’t able to make the talk (or who are coming to this announcement after the fact), we’d like to share two practical pieces of knowledge from James about how to make sure your project does well. We’ve written this piece for developers who are working with clients, but if you’re a client interested in hiring a developer, these considerations are important for you to know, as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-have-a-comprehensive-discussion-with-your-clients-about-their-requirements">1. Have a comprehensive discussion with your clients about their requirements.</h2>



<p>No project can be successful without a full needs analysis—and it’s very hard to be too thorough. Many clients don’t know what they don’t know, and it’s your job as the developer to ask the right questions to get all the details you need to understand what the project will entail. These might include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Who are the target users of the learning program?</strong> Is our client teaching <a href="https://www.learndash.com/key-principles-of-adult-learning/">adult learners</a> or children? Industry professionals as part of a training or certification program, or hobbyists learning a new skill for pleasure? Adults and children will have different <a href="https://www.learndash.com/using-learndash-with-parents-of-k-12-learners/">user access and monitoring requirements</a>. Companies paying for a certification program may have industry-specific needs that don’t exist for hobbyists. Learn as much as you can about your end user so that you know what the requirements of your platform are.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>What features does your client really need?</strong> Sometimes a client hears about a feature and wants it as part of their course but doesn’t have a good grasp for how much work it will take to develop it. (Do they need a membership feature, and if so, how advanced does it need to be?) Or maybe what your client needs is mission critical, but implementing it will affect the architecture of the website (setting up a multilingual site, for instance). Get a full feature list from the start so you can be prepared.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>What plugins does your client really need?</strong> Some clients install a lot of plugins on their site without realizing that they’re conflicting, redundant, and slowing the site down. Other plugins perform critical features, or can solve a functionality problem that would have taken months and thousands of dollars to custom code. As a developer, you can guide your clients toward the right solutions.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-2-set-expectations-with-yourself-and-your-client-about-scope-of-work-and-a-realistic-timeline">2. Set expectations with yourself and your client about scope of work and a realistic timeline.</h2>



<p>Once you understand what your client is looking for, it falls to you to pull together an estimate for the work to be done. LMS projects can be as simple as installing LearnDash on a site and adding a few custom configurations—the kind that you can turn around in a week. Or, they can be &nbsp;six months of work with a multi-lingual ecommerce solution and social sharing. Both of these can be successful projects, but only if you’ve set the right expectations with your client first.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Read the project requirements thoroughly so that you understand the scope.</strong> You don’t want to miss a critical request that adds huge amounts of time to your project at the last minute.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Double check your numbers when you deliver a quote.</strong> If you calculate your estimate poorly, you could find yourself losing money trying to deliver on your promises, or else risk disappointing your client. On the other hand, if you over-bid because you’re over-delivering on plugins and features, you could lose a client who just wants a simpler option.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Beware of blue sky thinking when setting a delivery timeline.</strong> We all want to think that projects will go smoothly and we’ll get everything wrapped and competed in record time. But things rarely go to plan, and it’s important to factor in buffer time to account for any speed bumps along the way.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-as-you-add-complexity-to-your-lms-project-the-scope-can-expand-rapidly">As you add complexity to your LMS project, the scope can expand rapidly.</h2>



<p>One of the reasons we advocate for educators to build their online courses on WordPress is that we know that many learning projects are about so much more than the LMS. Sure, sometimes a project is just a simple course—at first. But more often than not, it’s an LMS project, and also an ecommerce project, a membership project, and a social media project. And if it doesn’t start that way, many educators want the option to grow in that direction in the future.</p>



<p>This is why it’s so essential not only to understand what your clients need, but also to set them on the best path for success. A self-hosted solution on a flexible platform like WordPress is just the way to get the off on the right foot.</p>

<p>As an online course creator, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/worried-about-course-security-start-with-your-website/">protecting your website</a> from online threats should be a priority for your business. Online security threats come in many forms. They can be a hacker trying to lock you out of your website in order to hold it hostage. They can be malware scripts that cause spam advertisements to appear on the front end of your site. Or they can be programs that intercept data in order to the steal password and login information of your learners.</p>



<p>While most hacks won’t destroy your business, they can disrupt the delivery of your course and damage your credibility. No one wants their learning experience to be disrupted by spam pop up ads, or to have their email and password compromised because of bad security. And unfortunately, hacks are more common than many website owners realize.</p>



<p><strong>According to </strong><a href="https://www.getastra.com/blog/cms/hacking-statistics/"><strong>hacking statistics</strong></a><strong> published by <a href="https://www.learndash.com/wpastra-theme">Astra</a> in 2020:</strong></p>



<ul><li>64% of companies&nbsp;admit to experiencing cyberattacks.</li><li>Over&nbsp;40% attacks&nbsp;target small- and medium-sized businesses.</li><li>73% cyberattacks&nbsp;are carried out for economic reasons.</li></ul>



<p>In other words, your online course is a potential target, and you should take precautions to safeguard your business and the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/gdpr/">digital privacy</a> of your learners. Fortunately, there are any number of plugins designed WordPress to help protect your course.</p>



<p>The following are some of the best-reviewed security plugins for WordPress, although remember that you usually only need one to protect your site. Two plugins performing the same function might conflict with each other, but you shouldn’t have any problems combining a plugin that specializes in firewall and malware detection with one that specializes in password controls.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-sucuri">1. Sucuri</h3>



<p>If your site has been hacked, Securi’s post-hack virus removal tools are some of the best around. They can scan your site, identify tampered files, and harden your security against future attacks.</p>



<p>The free <a href="https://sucuri.net/wordpress-security-plugin/">Sucuri WordPress Plugin</a> offers a number of features from malware scanning to email alerts that are perfect for course creators who are just getting started. However, some features, such as their firewall integration or more frequent security scans, are only available on paid plans. These additional safeguards may be worth investing in as your course grows.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Cleaning up your site after a hack</li><li>Malware scanning</li><li>Firewall protection</li><li>DDoS attack mitigation</li><li>Brute force attack protection</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-2-ithemes-pro">2. iThemes Pro</h3>



<p>One of the best-known names in WordPress security, <a href="https://ithemes.com/security/">iThemes Pro</a> is a comprehensive plugin with a feature set that can handle most of your security needs in one place. While it doesn’t have the post-hack services of Sucuri, it does have excellent security monitoring tools, including a security dashboard.</p>



<p>Another feature that isn’t often offered is their “away mode,” which lets you lock down your WordPress dashboard for specific time periods, preventing anyone from making changes while you’re gone. It also integrates with BackupBuddy for regular backups.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Brute force attack prevention</li><li>Strong password enforcement</li><li>Two-factor authentication</li><li>Malware scanning</li><li>Scheduled database backups</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-3-all-in-one-wp-security-firewall">3. All In One WP Security &amp; Firewall</h3>



<p>For users looking for a free security plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/">All In One WP Security &amp; Firewall</a> not only offers a robust feature set, it’s also highly reviewed. While it requires more manual configuration for the user, the designers of this plugin have gone out of their way to make it easy to use and understand.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Prevents identical login and display names</li><li>Strong password tool</li><li>Brute force attack prevention</li><li>File change scanning</li><li>Add reCAPTCHA to forms</li></ul>

<p>Defender offers both a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/defender-security/">free</a> and a <a href="https://wpmudev.com/project/wp-defender/">pro</a> version of their plugin, both of which offer great value for the features they provide. The free version offers a firewall, as well as IP blocking that automatically detects and blocks bots, and also lets you shut out visitors from certain geo locations.</p>



<p>The pro version offers some additional features, such as scheduled security scans, backups, and website restoration, that are well worth the price.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Two-factor authentication</li><li>Firewall and IP blocking</li><li>Login protection</li><li>Scheduled security scans (pro)</li><li>Change file restore and repair (pro)</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-5-vaultpress-jetpack-security">5. VaultPress/Jetpack Security</h3>



<p>As an Automattic plugin, Jetpack is a well-known name in the WordPress community for helping to speed up WordPress websites. It recently acquired VaultPress, another familiar WordPress plugin, and now offers its backup services as part of the <a href="https://jetpack.com/features/security/">Jetpack Security</a> package. Taken together, these features cover a broad range of essential security services.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>

It also offers a global dashboard, WordFence Central, that lets you monitor security across multiple sites at once.</p>



<p>Another useful feature is their leaked password protection, which checks administrator login information against password information from known data breaches. If your admin password is compromised, it will block your login and prompt you to set a new one.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Firewall protection</li><li>Malware detection</li><li>IP blacklisting</li><li>Leaked password protection</li><li>Two-factor authentication</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-7-malcare">7. Malcare</h3>



<p>Malcare bills itself on its simplicity, with a fast stet-up and a one-click cleanup tool that can automatically remove malicious code. It also includes a firewall, plugin update management, and email alerts for any security breach. Malcare also offers a BlogVault add-on for regular backups, and a bulk update feature that makes it easier for you to keep up with the latest versions of plugins, themes, and even WordPress core.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Malware detection</li><li>Firewall protection</li><li>Login protection</li><li>Automatic scans</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-8-astra">8. <a href="https://www.learndash.com/wpastra-theme">Astra</a></h3>



<p>We mentioned some security statistics from Astra at the beginning of this article, so it’s about time we talked about their plugin. <a href="https://www.getastra.com/wordpress-firewall">Astra’s security plugin</a> is another feature rich solution that covers a lot of important bases.</p>



<p>Like Sucuri, they also offer post-hack services, however their plugin doesn’t have automatic backups or some of the login protection features (such as two-factor authentication or strong password enforcement) that other plugins offer.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Firewall</li><li>Malware scanner</li><li>Security audit</li><li>Security dashboard</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-9-miniorange-s-google-authenticator-for-wordpress">9. miniOrange’s Google Authenticator for WordPress</h3>



<p>If you’re looking for extra password protection, the <a href="https://plugins.miniorange.com/2-factor-authentication-for-wordpress">Google Authenticator for WordPress</a> plugin by miniOrange lets you fine-tune your configuration in impressive ways. It even offers integration with LearnDash login forms, if you want to add protection to learner accounts as well.</p>



<p>The main feature is their integration with Google Authenticator, which you can synchronize with your phone in order to receive a special login PIN that automatically updates every thirty seconds or so. You can also choose to login only with the authentication PIN (for passwordless logins), or to change password requirements based on device, time, and location.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Two-factor authentication</li><li>Risk-based assessment</li><li>Passwordless authentication</li><li>LearnDash integration</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-securing-your-website-from-most-major-online-threats-is-easier-than-you-think">Securing your website from most major online threats is easier than you think.</h3>



<p>Security is hard, but protecting yourself from the most common threats is not. The majority of cyberattacks are not targeted toward individual users, but rather are carried out by bots, combing the Internet looking for websites that have left their guard down. Just by using a security plugin and following some common sense guidelines about website security, you make yourself a harder target for the majority of cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Taking steps to secure your site is essential for your business, and for your learners. Don’t wait until your site is hacked to start looking for solutions.</p>

<h3 id="h-protecting-your-intellectual-property-is-important-but-securing-your-website-should-come-first">Protecting your intellectual property is important, but securing your website should come first.</h3>



<p>A common concern for many course creators lies in how they can protect their content from being stolen. After putting all that work into developing course content as an intellectual property, no one wants it to be scraped and shared elsewhere. However, many of those concerned about a content stealing are actually behind the ball when it comes to the security of their own websites, and this poses a much more significant risk both to their learners, and to their business.</p>



<p>Securing your content on the front end, where learners access it, will do you little good if someone can steal it by breaking into the back end of your site. It would be like locking your front door while leaving your back door open. But more importantly, most online security threats have nothing to do with your course, and everything to do with stealing user data, injecting malicious code into your website, or holding your site content for ransom.</p>



<p>Security is a complicated topic, and there are many steps beyond those we are about to discuss that may apply to your specific situation. Our focus for the moment is on the measures that new users should be taking from the beginning to establish a secure foundation for their website, and their business. If this sounds like what you need, here are the most important actions you can take right now to keep your course and your learners protected.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-choose-reliable-hosting">1. Choose reliable hosting.</h3>



<p>What’s the most important thing to look for in a good web host? Price? Bandwidth? Reliability? Customer service? All these factors are important, but nothing is more important than security.</p>



<p>Hosting plays a major part in online security. Vulnerabilities in your hosting environment are especially concerning, because they are at the highest level of access. This makes them harder to detect, and hard to root out once they take hold.</p>



<p>The best defense is to do your due diligence when <a href="https://www.learndash.com/best-wordpress-hosting/">choosing a web host</a>. Make sure your web host is following secure practices, such as keeping their software, hardware, and PHP version up to date. They should also monitor their networks for suspicious activity, and have a recovery plan in place in case of a disaster or a security breach.</p>



<p>Another thing you should consider carefully is whether the lower costs of a shared hosting plan are worth the security tradeoff. Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<h4 id="h-shared-vps-or-dedicated-hosting">Shared, VPS, or dedicated hosting?</h4>



<p>When you consider your hosting options, there are three main services available: shared hosting, a virtual private server (VPS), and dedicated hosting.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Shared Hosting. </strong>Shared hosting means that your website is on the same server as several others. This is the most affordable option, but it also means more shared resources. A spike in traffic to one of the other websites on your server may slow your site down. A security breach on a shared host can also affect your site.</li><li><strong>VPS.</strong> With a VPS, you’re still sharing a server, but the resources on that server allocated to your website are not shared. This means whatever is happening on one of the other websites sharing your server is less likely to affect your website.</li><li><strong>Dedicated Hosting.</strong> On a dedicated server, you aren’t sharing any hardware or resources with other websites. This means you have more control over the hardware configuration, and don’t have to worry about any other site affecting yours. However, it is the most expensive, and can be overkill for smaller businesses.</li></ul>



<p>There are more security concerns with shared hosting than with your other options, but that’s not to say you can’t use it. There are high-quality providers out there who offer good services with extra safeguards in place to protect sites that use their shared hosting platforms. But you should understand the tradeoffs you’re making. If you can afford a VPS or dedicated hosting, this is not a place to be penny wise but pound foolish.</p>



<h4 id="h-ddos-protection">DDoS protection.</h4>



<p>One more thing, while we’re on the topic of hosting security: DDoS protection. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks made major headlines in 2016, when one took down Dyn, a major Domain Name System (DNS) provider. The DNS is what translates the human-friendly domain names we are all familiar with into IP addresses, which are computer-friendly. The attack resulted in major disruptions for some of the biggest Internet sites, including Netflix, Amazon, The New York Times, Airbnb, PayPal, Visa, and Reddit.</p>



<p>DDoS attacks harness large bot swarms to flood a domain with traffic, sometimes at rates exceeding a terabit per second. The pressure this places on a network can effectively shut it down, preventing any visitors from accessing page content.</p>



<p>The best way to mitigate this threat is through a DDoS mitigation service, such as Cloudflare or Akamai. These services protect sites by differentiating legitimate traffic from bot traffic, and then blocking illegitimate traffic while still allowing your learners through. Most reliable web hosts will offer DDoS protection as part of their services.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-install-ssl-authentication">2. Install SSL authentication.</h3>



<p>Ever wonder what the difference between websites that begin http:// and https:// is? That “s” in there plays a big role. It indicates that the website you’re visiting is using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, which is a way to protect data as it travels from the host server to your browser.</p>



<p>Without SSL encryption, hackers can intercept that data and inject malicious scripts into the code. From the perspective of a web user, this can mean that they’re suddenly seeing strange ads on your site, even though you never placed them there.</p>



<p>More sophisticated versions of this attack can add form fields or CTA prompts to your website encouraging learners to give away personal information. Because it looks like it’s part of your site, learners will have their guards down and will be more likely to fall for the bait.</p>



<p>Fortunately, installing an SSL certificate on your site is an easy way to eliminate this risk. Google is also cracking down harder on sites that don’t have SSL certification, by highlighting that pages are unsecure in their browser search bar (if you’re using Chrome), or by penalizing them in search engine rankings.</p>



<p>You can get free SSL certification from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>, which is supported by Automattic. Many hosts now also come with free SSL certification as a standard part of their services.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-install-a-security-plugin">3. Install a security plugin.</h3>



<p>We’re about to get into a number of specific security measures, most of which can be achieved through <a href="https://www.learndash.com/9-wordpress-security-plugins-to-protect-your-course/">WordPress security plugins</a>. When choosing a security plugin (or plugins), look at what features they provide and choose ones that are well-regarded in the WordPress community. A few of the best-known names include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>iThemes Pro.</strong> Enforces strong passwords, allows for login masking, defends against brute force attacks, and detects suspicious file changes.</li><li><strong>Sucuri. </strong>Offers site monitoring to detect malware, firewall protection, and backup services.</li><li><strong>WordFence. </strong>Provides malware scanning and firewall protection.</li><li><strong>Defender.</strong> Enables two-factor authentication, login masking, and IP blocking, among others.</li><li><strong>VaultPress.</strong> Part of JetPack. Primarily for backups.</li><li><strong>Google Authenticator.</strong> Primarily for two-factor authentication.</li></ul>



<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list, but it will get you started. Whether you choose an all-in-one solution or pick plugins based on their specialization is up to you. Avoiding getting too many plugins with redundant features, however, as they can begin to interfere with each other.</p>



<p>Here’s what these plugins will provide.</p>



<h4 id="h-malware-and-firewall-protection">Malware and firewall protection.</h4>



<p>Just like on your computer, you can also get malware and firewall protection for your online course website. Malware protection will monitor your site for activity that raises red flags, like files being modified in a suspicious manner, or being moved to places they shouldn’t be. Firewalls will prevent users from being able to upload certain files and prevent ports to the server.</p>



<h4 id="h-strong-usernames-and-passwords">Strong usernames and passwords.</h4>



<p>Is your admin username “admin?” Is your password “password?” Is your username and password neither of these, but you still have a default account where it is? Did you create an account quickly for someone with a password like “p4ssW0rd!” and then forget to change it to something more complex?</p>



<p>All of these instances are far too common, and they are major security concerns. If someone breaks into your site because they guessed your username and password combination, they can then potentially lock you out while they cause damage to your business and your learners.</p>



<p>The best rule of thumb is that you shouldn’t choose a password you have to remember. Instead, use a password locker to store your password, and then choose one that is an incomprehensible string of numbers and letters. Also, longer is better. The shorter your password is, the less secure—no matter how many @s, %s, and !s you add.</p>



<h4 id="h-multifactor-authentication">Multifactor authentication.</h4>



<p>Do you know what’s even better than a strong password? Multifactor (or two-factor) authentication. You may have encountered this already, any time you’ve had to dig into your pocket to find your phone in order to enter a PIN that you just received by text. This may seem like a hassle, but it’s one of the best things you can do to protect your login.</p>



<p>The “multifactor” in this case refers to different ways to prove that you are who you are. These factors can be something you know (like your password or your username), something you “are,” like a fingerprint or a facial scan, or something you own, like your phone.</p>



<p>When you set up multifactor authentication, it means that someone can’t access your site just by knowing your username or password. They also have to somehow have access one of those other factors, which (as you can imagine) is significantly more difficult.</p>



<h4 id="h-site-backups">Site backups.</h4>



<p>No matter how cautious you are, something can still go wrong. Having a regular backup will make it easy to roll your site to an earlier version if a virus manages to inject code into your system, and will also be helpful if something else happens to damage your site.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-keep-wordpress-and-all-plugins-updated">4. Keep WordPress and all plugins updated.</h3>



<p>If you own a computer, you should already be familiar with the importance of maintaining your software updates. Updates exist to roll out new features, but they’re also there to patch up security flaws.</p>



<p>Building a site on WordPress, with its ecosystem of plugins, means you’ll have regular updates to maintain. Keep an eye on these, and perform any security-based updates immediately. For other updates, it’s usually OK to wait a couple weeks for some of the early bugs to be ironed out.</p>



<p>For any updates, be sure to have a recently backed-up version of your site <a href="https://www.learndash.com/is-learndash-broken-how-to-run-a-conflict-test/">in case anything breaks</a>. Run your updates one at a time so that if something does break, you can more easily isolate the issue.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-limit-user-role-access">5. Limit user role access.</h3>



<p>Choosing strong passwords and enabling multifactor authentication are both excellent ways to protect your site from being hacked. However, you should also take steps to limit the damage of a potential breach, so that if someone gains access to your site maliciously, they can only do so much. WordPress comes with six levels of predefined roles, ranging from “Subscriber,” which is a read-only role, to “Super Administrator,” which has complete control over the site.</p>



<p>Limiting user roles means that you only give each user the amount of permissions they need to do their work, and nothing more. For instance, an Editor can publish posts, upload files, and moderate comments, but they can’t install new plugins on your site or remove other users.</p>



<p>Obviously, you should never give someone you don’t trust access to sensitive functions on your website, but determining a user’s role is about than whether you trust them as an individual. It’s also about what might happen if that user’s account got taken over by someone you don’t trust. If you assume that might happen, and limit someone’s access to only the functions you need, you will protect your site and your users.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-set-up-recaptcha-on-forms">6. Set up ReCAPTCHA on forms.</h3>



<p>If you’ve ever struggled to decipher a squiggly image of letters and numbers, selected which images in a grid contain trees, or been asked to solve a basic math problem in order to fill out a form, then you know what a CAPTCHA is.</p>



<p>Old versions of CAPTCHA (which apparently stands for “Completely Automated Public Touring test to tell Computers and Humans Apart—yes, we know it’s clumsy, we didn’t make it up) have been irritating to use at best, and at worst pose significant accessibility issues for many users. The difficulties using them have caused many users to avoid them, believing they’re more trouble than they’re worth.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Turing test is an essential part of website security. Authenticating human users prevents bots from bombing your inbox with fake form submissions, spamming your comments section with toxic backlinks, or conducting brute force attacks against your login portals.</p>



<p>The good news is that ReCAPTCHA removes these difficulties almost entirely, replacing the blurred images with a simple “I am not a robot” checkbox. It’s unobtrusive enough that most users won’t even notice it’s there, and it effectively blocks attacks, keeping your site secure.</p>



<h3 id="h-continue-to-educate-yourself">Continue to educate yourself.</h3>



<p>Finally, it’s always worth emphasizing that online security is a fluid field. Best practices change as new threats emerge and new technology becomes available to fend against them. If you’ve taken all the precautions listed above, the next step is to look over your site for any specific security concerns that may apply to you, but not others.</p>



<p>For instance, do you conduct a lot of webinars? Then you should look into the security of your webinar service to be sure your lessons don’t get interrupted. Are you working in a confidential field, where you may be handling sensitive information? There may be industry-specific compliance policies you have to follow.</p>



<p>Regardless, make it a personal policy to review your site security once a year, and read up on any new threats that may apply to you. Or, find someone with security expertise who can look over your online course and make sure it’s up to date.</p>



<p>Securing your online is essential for keeping your content safe. It’s also crucial for your online reputation. If your course gets hacked, it damages trust with learners, ad can undermine your own credibility as an educator. Finally, it’s the best thing you can do for your learners. If your site security is compromised, it will have a negative effect on their learning experience, and it may even lead to a loss of their digital privacy.</p>



<p>Protecting your business and your learners from online threats is within your reach, so long as you make it a priority. Don’t let it get overlooked.</p>

<h2>Course forums can give learners a reason to come back and stay engaged, but they’re also a lot of work. Should you start one?</h2>



<p>We’ve talked in the past about the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/are-you-selling-courses-or-community/">importance of community</a> in creating <a href="https://www.learndash.com/creating-a-robust-social-community-within-your-lms/">a thriving course</a>. Community can help your learners feel connected to the course material, keep them accountable to their goals, and give them a reason to continue subscribing to your membership site.</p>



<p>However, growing a healthy, vibrant community is not as easy as it sounds. While you can build a community on various social platforms, including Discord, Facebook, or Slack, each of which offers various moderation tools and content sharing features, none of these platforms will be within your control. This is why, for many course creators, the preferred solution is a forum.</p>



<p>Forums come in all shapes and sizes. In general, you can classify the type of forum you run as one of the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Open.</strong> Everyone can join. These are useful if you’re trying to build a community first, and then market to that community when you have courses ready.</li><li><strong>Membership-based.</strong> These are excellent if you want to restrict forum access to only paying customers, as part of the main value offerings of your course.</li><li><strong>Course-based.</strong> These are good if you want to keep discussions small and targeted.</li></ul>



<p>Whether you chose to have a forum that’s open to the general public or one that is restricted to a specific course—or even a specific cohort with a course—is up to you. However, before you decide to create your forum, you should take a moment to weigh the pros and cons and decide if it’s the best option for you.</p>



<h2>Downsides to launching a forum.</h2>



<p>Before you launch a forum, it’s important to realize that they’re not for everyone—or every course. For instance, if you’re running training seminars for a business, it’s unlikely employees will be very active in a forum. However, even if your course is well-suited for a forum, it may not be a good idea based on your own circumstances. A few downsides include:</p>



<ul><li>They require a lot of engagement to keep going, which can be tiring unless other members are active. Unless you’re ready to be active yourself, it’s easy to become overwhelmed.</li><li>They require moderation, which can be difficult if the forum becomes very active. Toxic members can damage the experience for the group, and resolving problems can lead to hurt feelings.</li><li>Without a strong community, they can die off. Having a dead forum on your site can look bad for your brand.</li></ul>



<h3>5. Reasons to start a forum for your course.</h3>



<p>While starting a forum can be a commitment, it’s still a worthwhile endeavor, and one that many course creators could use more effectively. Let’s take a look at some of the main benefits to building a forum for your community.</p>



<h4>1. You want to add value to your membership site.</h4>



<p>If you’re selling your courses as part of a membership package, your users are going to be looking for reasons to sign up—and to stay signed up. Maybe they are interested in one or two courses, but after that, where’s the value in continuing to pay a subscription fee? An online forum with a supportive group of fellow learners may be exactly the enticement your learners are looking for.</p>



<h4>2. Community and networking are a significant part of your course.</h4>



<p>Many learners sign up for courses specifically because they want to find a community of similar individuals to learn alongside. This is especially true for courses that emphasize creative work, for which feedback and critique is a key part of learning, for professional development courses where networking is a key benefit, and for subjects like languages, where students can practice with each other to learn.</p>



<h4>3. Current events present plenty of fodder for new discussion.</h4>



<p>Are you teaching a political science course? A journalism course? A foreign language course? There are any number of subjects that benefit from being able to easily share articles and discussion topics. A forum makes it easier to share ongoing content and continue a discussion, and for all members to take part.</p>



<h4>4. You enjoy engaging with forum discussions.</h4>



<p>Probably one of the simplest reasons for starting a forum is because they work well with your natural style of communication and leadership. It’s important not to discount this factor. If you feel comfortable leading a forum, and if it’s something you’ve enjoyed participating in in the past, it’s more likely that you’ll have success in starting a forum of your own.</p>



<h4>5. You want to benefit from user-generated content.</h4>



<p>Finally, while a forum can put pressure on you to get it started, once it gains momentum you may be able to step back and let others take the wheel. While maintaining the forum will still require moderation, active users will also feel a sense of ownership of it. Having users who are invested in your community will strengthen your brand, especially if your work in growing your forum gives it the reputation for being a welcoming and supportive place.</p>



<h3>If long-term engagement and learner retention are your goal, a forum is a good place to start.</h3>



<p>Building a forum isn’t an endeavor every online educator is equipped to tackle. It’s also not suited to every form of online education. But if your goal is to create a robust, dynamic home for your learners where they will continue to participate with each other and grow value for years to come, there’s no better solution.</p>

<h2 id="h-mobile-learning-isn-t-just-a-way-to-make-courses-more-accessible-it-s-a-way-to-deliver-better-learning-content">Mobile learning isn’t just a way to make courses more accessible—it’s a way to deliver better learning content.</h2>



<p>The first priority of many online educators is to create the best desktop experience possible—and who can blame them? After all, most of them are also creating content on their desktop, and it’s a space learners traditionally turn to when they search for new learning content.</p>



<p>However, these assumptions could be hurting online educators in that desktop first design is based on presuppositions that may not be borne out by actual user data. In fact, many users—<a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-millennials-connect-to-mobile-learning/">especially younger users</a>—are more comfortable with mobile content. They not only expect access to their online courses via their smartphones, they plan to use their smartphones as their primary learning platform.</p>



<p>Educators have traditionally worked around this by choosing mobile friendly themes and optimizing content so that it <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-design-a-mobile-first-online-course/">looks good on mobile</a>. However, by treating mobile learning as an afterthought, many are overlooking the distinct advantages mobile learning has to offer. Here are just a few.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-swipes-and-gestures">1. Swipes and gestures.</h3>



<p>Remember when the iPhone got rid of the physical keypad? Replacing buttons with digital swipes and gestures was one of the most ambitious design choices in recent technological history, but the result changed the course of mobile development by giving users and developers alike an entire screen to work with.</p>



<p>It’s a shame, therefore, that so many still fail to use the full screen when creating course content. Most developers, in choosing a mobile-friendly theme, are only thinking about content arrangement. But what about how users engage with design elements on screen? Can they swipe and tap and drag and drop with ease? Do those movements have any special significance within your course?</p>



<p>Swipes and gestures are simple functions, but their simplicity can also be powerful. Using these features to help learners move through your content can create a more satisfying mobile experience.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-augmented-reality">2. Augmented reality.</h3>



<p>Given the computing power of today’s smartphones, there’s very little left to separate them from their desktop counterparts save their mobility. And that mobility comes with a real advantage. When a learner carries their learning platform with them, it’s not just the learner who has universal access to the learning platform—it’s also the learning platform that has universal access to the learner’s environment. Are you making the most of it?</p>



<p>Mobile learning means learners can engage with their environment as they learn. They can take pictures, select points on a map, and use their phones as a viewing screen for a virtual environment overlaying whatever is in front of them. What better way to make learning real than to insert learning into their daily lives?</p>



<h3 id="h-3-microlearning">3. Microlearning.</h3>



<p>Learning that is delivered in small chucks of only a few minutes at a time is considered “microlearning.” Micro content can be part of any learning experience, but it fits most naturally in the realm of mobile learning, where users frequently turn to their smartphones in order to access content on the go. After all, Few learners want to start a twenty-minute video while waiting in line at the grocery store, but would happily complete a two-minute quiz.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-gamification">4. Gamification.</h3>



<p>While desktop courses can also use gamification to improve the learner experience, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-master-mobile-gamification/">mobile courses are where gamification thrives</a>. Gamification, which uses components such as leaderboards, badges, and point systems to motivate learners to remain engaged with course content, is particularly well suited for microlearning scenarios where learners want to be able to check in and compete during their down time. After all, if one of the goals of gamification is to make mobile learning hard to put down, it&#8217;s even better if learners can take that experience with them wherever they go.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-distraction-free-design">5. Distraction-free design.</h3>



<p>Finally, mobile designs can improve learner experiences by removing distractions. This is a basic necessity of good design on mobile, as the smaller screen sizes simply can’t fit as much as their desktop counterparts. The positive unintended consequence of this is that educators can clean up their designs and only deliver the most essential visual information on their mobile courses. In return, the lack of distractions can help learners focus more on important material. It’s a win-win.</p>



<h3 id="h-taking-the-time-to-harness-the-full-advantages-of-mobile-learning-can-improve-outcomes-for-your-learners">Taking the time to harness the full advantages of mobile learning can improve outcomes for your learners.</h3>



<p>Making the most of mobile requires an investment. At the very least, educators are committing to spend more time checking their content for quality and accessibility. In some cases, achieving the most advanced functions may require custom coding, which can run into tens of thousands of dollars in development costs.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-mobile-learning-can-enhance-course/">The benefits are real</a>, however. Learners who are given mobile learning as an option are more likely to complete their courses, and report higher satisfaction. Mobile learning, especially when delivered through an app, also has higher prestige than options that are optimized solely for desktop, allowing course creators to charge more for their courses. And, of course, may users are so comfortable on mobile that they don’t use desktop at all. Mobile advertising can draw their attention and generate an entirely new audience.</p>



<p>The conclusion is clear. If you haven’t yet taken a mobile-first approach to developing content for your learners, now is the time. You’ve very little to lose, and a whole lot of business to gain.</p>

<h3 id="h-you-re-building-a-training-course-for-remote-workers-what-skills-should-you-include">You’re building a training course for remote workers. What skills should you include?</h3>



<p>Over the past year, workforces around the globe have transitioned to remote environments in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Although the vaccine rollout indicates that the new, post-pandemic normal is coming, one thing that seems clear to many is that this new normal won&#8217;t mean a return to office environments as they once were. Instead, it seems almost guaranteed that many workforces will continue some form of fully remote or hybrid arrangement to offer workers greater flexibility.</p>



<p>However, with remote work a growing part of office cultures around the world, employers have to think about the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/6-types-of-online-employee-training/">training needs of their employees</a>. That means either developing their own internal employee training, or turning to outside consultants and third-party providers for assistance. And to meet this growing need, online educators should think about what skills might need the most support as businesses make remote work a key part of their office culture moving forward.</p>



<p>Here are our top eight training needs for remote workforces in 2021.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-project-management">1. Project management.</h3>



<p>Keeping projects on track when no one shares a working environment can be a complicated task. It takes organization, thoroughness, and strong people skills to guide a team from start to finish. And, while there are apps and software that can help move things along, they can&#8217;t replace training, especially on larger projects that may involve the cooperation of multiple departments.</p>



<p>Educators developing courses in this area could discuss various software solutions available for remote workforces, share strategies for keeping projects on task, and <a href="https://www.learndash.com/6-tips-for-writing-training-scenarios/">create scenarios</a> for helping a manager respond to situations when the project is falling behind schedule.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-time-management">2. Time management.</h3>



<p>The traditional work environment offers structure to an employee&#8217;s workday, with regular breaks for coffee, lunch, and interactions with coworkers. In a remote environment, days can seem to blend together, with fewer natural rhythms and more unexpected interruptions. All this can make it more difficult for individuals to manage their time effectively.</p>



<p>Training courses on time management could discuss strategies for building effective habits, including taking regular breaks to keep the mind fresh. They could even offer employees specific guidelines on when to reach out to their team leader for support.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-team-leadership">3. Team leadership.</h3>



<p>Management has changed drastically for many workforces, with many leaders struggling to know when they are checking in too much or not enough. Furthermore, without in-person interactions, employees may struggle to form the kind of close working relationships that can keep a team functioning. These can lead to challenges all the way up the organizational ladder.</p>



<p>Leadership training is already a high priority in many corporate environments, but remote work is going to add a new layer to the existing material. Instructional designers for this kind of training may want to spend extra time looking at <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-include-interactive-elements-in-online-courses/">interactive scenarios</a> to coach leaders through difficult problems.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-cybersecurity">4. Cybersecurity.</h3>



<p>The more employees move online, the more they will be targeted by online threats. Digital information is valuable, and far too many employees practice poor security hygiene simply because they don&#8217;t understand the risks. With security threats on the rise, it&#8217;s more important than every for organizations to have strong protocols in place.</p>



<p>Online educators focusing on cybersecurity have a wide range of material to cover. From understanding threats (phishing attacks, password breaches, and software vulnerabilities) to creating a crisis response plan (identifying and responding to a security breach, assessing the damage, and preventing future incidents), instructors should have no end of course ideas on this front.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-software-skills">5. Software skills.</h3>



<p>Many workers have had to rapidly learn new pieces of technology over the past year, and while this has closed a skills gap in basic software literacy for many, it&#8217;s also increased the average worker&#8217;s dependency on software to accomplish their job.</p>



<p>Each organization will have its own software needs. However, there are some constants in the software field, such as the Microsoft Office suite of products, that may merit more in-depth training so that employees can learn about their more advanced functions.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-communication">6. Communication.</h3>



<p>The softest of all soft skills, effective communication is nevertheless something which most employees can learn. Moreover, it&#8217;s one that is increasingly important in the world of digital communication, where tones of voice are absent, misunderstandings are common, and norms of behavior are constantly changing.</p>



<p>Communications training might be a good idea for young hires as they first enter the workforce to help them learn professional etiquette. They may also be important for global businesses as they communicate with partners abroad, so that they can respect cultural differences in communication as well.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-customer-service">7. Customer service.</h3>



<p>Customer service has operated remotely at least since the first customer help hotline was installed. However, every new technology brings along new possibilities for support. Moreover, remote work often means that more individuals are acting in a support role, even if it&#8217;s not their primary job.</p>



<p>Employee training for customer service should address both new technologies (how to handle customer support over social media or live chat), and the soft skills necessary to work with <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-branching-scenarios-in-e-learning/">demanding clients</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-stress-management">8. Stress management.</h3>



<p>Finally, the pandemic has taken a toll on the mental health of many workers. But even when these extraordinary conditions subside, working from home comes with its own stressors that may be harder for leaders to see. Creating a stress management course can help employers look to the mental health needs of their workforce, in order to prevent employees from burning out.</p>



<p>Course material might cover meditation exercises, techniques for deescalating tense situations, or awareness of mental health issues and identifying when it&#8217;s time to take a mental health day.</p>



<h3 id="h-businesses-need-to-be-proactive-in-supporting-their-remote-workers">Businesses need to be proactive in supporting their remote workers.</h3>



<p>Remote work has many benefits, but it&#8217;s still an adjustment for many in the workforce. Businesses who recognize the need for training—and seek out educators who are qualified to deliver it—will be better positioned to thrive in the new normal, once it arrives.</p>

<p>One of the most common use cases we have for LearnDash comes in the form of membership websites. Instructors want to create an experience where their learners can pay an ongoing subscription to have access to certain sets of courses, along with various other privileges. Membership sites are popular among instructors because they follow a familiar service model with a low barrier to entry, and they’re popular among users because&#8230; well, they’re familiar and they have a low barrier to entry.</p>



<p>Membership websites can be very simple, requiring only the ability to place certain site content behind login portals. (LearnDash does this for courses—more on that in a minute.) They can also be highly complex, with tiers of access, point systems, discounts, and varying user privileges. To achieve these more robust functions, you’re going to need a membership plugin.</p>



<p>And, to guide you toward the right plugin for your membership website, we’ve compiled this list of the best membership plugins for WordPress websites.</p>



<p>We’re leaving this list unranked because the best option for each individual depends on their specific use cases. However, these are plugins that have been used by our community for years, and have a proven record for success.</p>



<h3 id="h-remember-you-can-use-learndash-as-a-membership-plugin">Remember: you can use LearnDash as a membership plugin.</h3>



<p>Since we’re about to recommend a bunch of membership plugins, we want to make one thing very clear: You DON’T need to use one in order to use LearnDash.</p>



<p>LearnDash has always included content protection as one of our core features. If you’re worried that someone will be able to reach protected pages of your course through Google or by being sent a link from another friend who already has access, don’t be. Unless you have the access controls on your course content set to “open,” no one will be able to access your course unless they have signed in and registered.</p>



<p>Our expanded Groups functionality also lets users fine tune membership levels and sell access to groups based on that membership level. You can even give group leaders course creation privileges, which is especially useful for organizations that want to implement training on a regional level.</p>



<p>These features cover many of the needs of any user looking for basic membership functionality. However, we know that our plugin isn’t the end-all-and-be-all. You may need more features to achieve the specific use case you have in mind, which is why we also go to great lengths to ensure our plugin works with other leading membership plugins in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>



<p>So, with that point clarified, let’s take a look at some more plugins that offer additional functionality.</p>



<h3 id="h-memberpress">MemberPress</h3>



<p>MemberPress is one of the best-known names in WordPress for membership, so it’s only fitting we start with them. As a premium plugin, they offer a full suite of membership service, from granular membership levels to trial membership to customized coupons and member-based offers.</p>



<p>If you choose this option, we also offer a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/memberpress/">MemberPress integration</a> that allows you to associate membership levels with specific courses and automatically remove members who cancel their subscriptions.</p>



<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Instructors or organizations with a generous budget who are committed to growing a large course.</p>



<h3 id="h-paid-membership-pro">Paid Membership Pro</h3>



<p>Don’t let the name fool you: Paid Membership Pro offers a free version of its plugin that can get the budget-conscious instructor a long way. If you’re comfortable with your WordPress skills, you can get a lot done on your own, but even if you aren’t, their paid version offers unlimited support tickets, extra add-ons, and advanced code recipes.</p>



<p>Like MemberPress, we offer a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/paidmembershipspro/">Paid Membership Pro integration</a> that lets you create trial memberships, associate membership levels with specific courses, and even close memberships after they pass a certain expiration date.</p>



<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Instructors launching their first course who are confident in their WordPress skills.</p>



<h3 id="h-restrict-content-pro">Restrict Content Pro</h3>



<p>The Restrict Content Pro plugin gives you extra controls over content management, as well as some excellent reporting tools. You can create unlimited membership levels, pro-rate upgrades and downgrades, and keep track of all your subscriptions from your customer dashboard.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/restrict-content-pro/">Restrict Content Pro integration</a> lets you associate courses to specific membership levels, remove members when they cancel, and offer trial memberships via various payement gateways.</p>



<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Instructors who want to fine tune access to their content.</p>



<h3 id="h-wishlist-member">Wishlist Member</h3>



<p>Wishlist Member is pricier than some of the other options on this list, but they have a well-built plugin with a lot of customizations that make the price tag worth it. Wishlist Member pushes their integrations and automations heavily, which can be great for those who have a lot of heavy duty marketing and/or learner support planned.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Instructors who are ready to get into the weeds on automation.</p>



<h3 id="h-woocommerce-memberships">WooCommerce Memberships</h3>



<p>WooCommerce is a familiar name to anyone in the WordPress space, but not everyone is aware that they offer memberships. This can be a win for anyone already using WooCommerce, as it gives you more sales options, such as selling memberships along with a product purchase, or limiting access to products to certain members.</p>



<p>The downside is that it doesn’t have some of the features of other membership plugins, which won’t make it the best option for everyone. But for the right customer, it could be the perfect solution.</p>



<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses already using WooCommerce and WooCommerce Subscriptions to manage course sales.</p>



<h3 id="h-membership-website-are-an-effective-way-to-grow-your-course-and-your-community">Membership website are an effective way to grow your course—and your community.</h3>



<p>One thing we can learn about the popularity of membership websites is that the idea of belonging to someplace is an important draw for many people. Registering to your membership website isn’t just about access to a course, it’s also about access to a group of peers with similar interests with whom they can network, collaborate, and learn. Make that a key selling point of your course, and you can grow your course along with your community.</p>

<p>So, you’ve read up on <a href="https://www.learndash.com/what-is-a-wordpress-membership-plugin/">membership sites</a> and you’ve decided that’s how you want to offer your courses. The next question is: how do you set one up for yourself?</p>



<p>Well, the good news is that you can do it all from LearnDash. While there are still some use cases in which a membership plugin might be necessary, you can create a WordPress membership site that will handle most of your needs using our native groups function. And because the groups function is hierarchical and lets you assign group leaders, you can get pretty detailed with it!</p>



<p>Excited? You should be. Let us walk you through it.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-course-access-settings-let-you-control-who-sees-your-courses">1. Course access settings let you control who sees your courses.</h3>



<p>Let’s start with something basic: content protection. If you’ve put hours into developing a course, you obviously don’t want someone to be able to show up and steal it. LearnDash courses are protected content, unless you specify them to be otherwise (which you can do by creating an “open” course). This means that a user has to be signed into your system to view the content, and they can’t just send a link to one of your restricted content pages to a friend without that friend also creating an account and logging in.</p>



<p>Here’s a handy trick, though. Registration is one of the biggest hurdles an online course creator has to overcome. It’s hard enough getting someone to buy a product (any product!), but especially one that requires a commitment on their end, like an online course. One way you can <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-increase-membership-signups/">grow registrations</a>—and eventually sales—is by offering a preliminary course for free. In LearnDash course access settings, a “free” course still requires users to register and log in. And once they’ve done that, it’s much easier to convince them to take the subsequent step of purchasing a course.</p>



<p>You can also control access to courses by setting prerequisites. Setting course prerequisites means that a user can sign up to your membership site, but will have to “unlock” advanced content by completing courses in a certain order, or by requiring a user to have earned a certain number of “course points” by completing other courses first.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-create-your-group-leaders-and-group-users">2. Create your group leaders and group users.</h3>



<p>LearnDash comes with two user roles related to groups: group leaders and group users. A <strong>group leader</strong> has special permissions which include viewing the quiz scores or progress of any of the group users, emailing the group, and even creating course content for the group. You can also assign the same group leader to multiple groups.</p>



<p>A <strong>group user</strong> is an enrollee. Adding a user to a group gives them access to all the courses in that group, which makes bulk enrollment easier. Users can also be members of multiple groups, or you can organize their access to courses using group hierarchy.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-organize-your-groups-to-give-access-to-the-right-membership-levels">3. Organize your groups to give access to the right membership levels.</h3>



<p>This is where the control you have over groups gets really exciting. Let’s say you want to offer two different kinds of membership levels—a “basic” membership, that had access to a certain range of courses, and an “advanced” membership, that had access to those courses plus some. You can achieve this by creating “parent” and “child” membership groups.</p>



<p>Because group hierarchy is nested, it means that learners who have access to the parent group level will also have access to all groups underneath it. However, a user enrolled into a child group won’t have access to higher level group content.</p>



<p>How would this work in a real course? Let’s run a few use cases.</p>



<ul><li>You want to have instructors lead small groups who are all participants in Course A. You also want your instructors to have access to instructor training materials for Course A. You create a parent group with instructor materials, and add the instructors to that group as group users. Then you create child groups that include access to Course A, and assign the instructors as group leaders. Learners enter the child groups as group users and have access to Course A, but do not have access to the instructor training material in the parent group.</li><li>You want to offer “basic” and “premium” membership levels, where “basic” members can enroll into select courses at a lower rate per course, but have to pay for access to each course individually. “Premium” members pay a higher subscription, but have access to all courses. Create a parent group for the premium members, and have each course listed in a child group underneath that parent group. Premium members enroll into the parent group, while basic members enroll into the child groups for their selected courses.</li><li>You want to offer organizational training at regional levels. You can create a parent group for your largest geographic area (say, North America), with child groups for the United States, Canada, and Mexico. If you need more control, you can create child pages within those child pages. Regional managers can be given group leader access to their area, and trainees can be enrolled into their local-level programs as group users.</li></ul>



<p>And that’s membership on LearnDash in a nutshell! But if you want more detailed information, never fear! We made a whole webinar about it: </p>

<h3 id="h-need-more-membership-management-options">Need more membership management options?</h3>



<p>We know we can’t build the perfect tool for everyone’s needs—that’s why we’re on WordPress. Many of our users are looking for options that require more specialized tools than what we offer—like fine tuning access controls for specific pages, or advanced membership settings. That’s why we offer integrations to some of the leading WordPress membership plugins out there—so you can work with us, without being limited in your other options.</p>
